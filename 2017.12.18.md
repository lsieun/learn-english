Previous Story

Charles Strickland的儿子也曾为他的父亲立传，但是进行了过度的美化。作者在Charles Strickland生命的最后岁月里和他来往颇多，为了自娱自乐，作者决定写一写Charles Strickland的故事。

Chapter 3

But all this is by the way.

I was very young when I wrote my first book. By a lucky chance it excited attention, and various persons sought my acquaintance.

It is not without melancholy/ that I wander among my recollections(回忆)/ of the world of/ letters in London/ when first bashful(胆怯的) but eager, I was introduced to it. 

	「It is … that」是对「not without」的强调。「not without 」这是双重否定表肯定的用法，相信大家一定不陌生吧~ 这里就是指令人伤感的(melancholy);

	这个句子里的两个of是不是看着有点糊涂呢~ 其中「recollections of」表示“对…的回忆”；「the world of letters」是指“文学界”，后面的it即是指the world of letters in London；

	整句大意：我刚刚被介绍进入(introduced)伦敦文学界的时候，心情又是羞涩(bashful)又是热切(eager)；现在回忆起当时的种种情况，不无凄凉之感(melancholy)。

It is long/ since I frequented it, and if the novels/ that describe its present singularities are accurate/ much in it is now changed. 

	「frequent」这里做动词，表示“常去”

	「that describe… are accurate」是修饰前面的「novels」，表示“现在那些描写伦敦文艺界特点(singularity)的文章”，这里是说，如果那些描写现在伦敦文艺界的文章是准确的…；

	「much in it」是句子主语部分，即“其中的大部分”，这里是说，其中大部分都改变了。

The venue is different. Chelsea and Bloomsbury have taken the place of Hampstead, Notting Hill Gate, and High Street, Kensington. Then it was a **distinction** to be under forty, but now to be more than twenty-five is absurd. I think in those days we were a little **shy of our emotions**, and the fear of ridicule tempered the more obvious **forms** of pretentiousness(自命不凡). 

	distinction: the quality of being excellent and important优秀，卓越，杰出。

	「under forty」是指年纪不到四十。正常的语序应该是it was under forty to be a distinction (people). 年纪不到40岁就成了杰出人才。

	「twenty-five」 同样也是指年纪25岁。换一下语序就是now more than twenty-five to be (a distinction) is absurd. 现在过了25岁才成为优秀的人物就会让人觉得滑稽了。

	「shy of our emotions」字面意思是“对我们的感情感到害羞”，引申为“羞于表达自己的感情”

	forms指the particular way sth is, seems, looks or is presented.形式；外表；样子。forms of pretentiousness即指骄傲的样子。

	整句大意：当时年纪不到四十岁就被看作了不起的人物(a distinction)，如今过了二十五岁就会让人觉得滑稽可笑了。我想在过去的日子里我们都羞于表达自己的感情，因为怕人嘲笑(ridicule)，所以都约束(tempered)自己傲慢自大(pretentiousness)的样子(forms)。（换言之就是约束自己不给别人以傲慢自大的印象。）


I do not believe that/ there was /in that genteel(彬彬有礼的) Bohemia(放荡不羁的文人)/ an intensive culture of chastity(纯洁), but I do not remember so crude a promiscuity(风流韵事) as seems to be practiced in the present day. 

	
	「that genteel Bohemia」做there was的主语，属于倒装句。还原一下：genteel Bohemia was in an intensive culture of chastity. 其中Bohemia指波西米亚风格的作家；Bohemia 在这里是指一个文学艺术群体，他们的风格与大多数社会所期望或认可的风格明显不同。intensive 原意是“密集的，集中的”。在这里与写作搭配，表示“严谨的”。

	practice在这里是指“践行”。即指风流韵事(promiscuity)被践行~

	这句话原文的行文是相对抽象的，毛姆使用了文绉绉的抽象性概念性名词来描述“我并不认为当时追崇波西米亚风格的艺术家(genteel Bohemia)中间有一种多么谨严的(intensive)贞洁(chastity)文化”。著名翻译家傅惟慈先生则在汉语中以柔软熨贴的方式，将追崇波西米亚风格的艺术家称为“风雅放浪的诗人作家”；将抽象名词an intensive culture of chastity转换为某种老派人的姿态和口吻——“执身端肃”，正像老派的英国文人所持有的和蔼却又威严的态度。这种转换既简洁又填补了两种语言的表达差异。

	整句大意：我并不认为当时风雅放浪的诗人作家执身如何端肃，但我却不记得那时候文艺界有今天这么多风流韵事(promiscuity)。


We did not think it hypocritical(虚伪的) to draw over our vagaries(异常行为) the curtain of a decent silence. The spade was not invariably(一贯地) called a bloody shovel. **Woman had not yet altogether come into her own**.

	draw: to move someone or something in a particular direction by pulling them gently轻拉；curtain是“窗帘，帷幕”的意思，a decent silence 修饰curtain，即指这个遮蔽物就是体面的沉默。

	这句话里的「spade」和「shovel」都是铁锹的意思，如果按照字面直译过来，就是说：铁锹并不是一成不变(invariably)的铁锹，大家会不会觉得一头雾水呢？其实，毛姆在这里是化用了“call a spade a spade”这个俗语，其释义是：To address or describe the true nature of someone or something, even if it is unpleasant. 所以这句话就可以理解为：我们讲话含蓄，并不是说什么都直言不讳。「bloody」: 这里是用于加强语气（略显粗鲁）。举颗栗子吧~ Don't be such a bloody fool. 别像个大傻瓜似的。

	Woman had not yet altogether come into her own.
	“come into her own”字面意思是指女性还没有进入自己的世界，实际指女性还没有像当时的男性一样有发言权，也就是当时的男女社会地位还是不平等的。

	整句大意：我们对自己的一些荒诞不经的行为(vagaries)遮上一层保持体面的缄默(a decent silence)，并不认为这是虚伪(hypocritical)。我们讲话讲究含蓄，并不总是口无遮拦，说什么都直言不讳。女性们那时也还没有完全取得绝对自主的地位。

I lived near Victoria Station, and I recall long excursions by bus to the hospitable houses of the literary. In my timidity I wandered up and down the street while I screwed up my courage to ring the bell; and then, sick with apprehension, was ushered(被引领) into an airless room full of people. I was introduced to this celebrated person after that one, and the kind words they said about my book made me excessively uncomfortable. I felt they expected me to say clever things, and I never could think of any till after the party was over. I tried to conceal my embarrassment by handing round cups of tea and rather ill-cut bread-and-butter. I wanted no one to take notice of me, so that I could observe these famous creatures at my ease and listen to the clever things they said.

I have a recollection of large, unbending women with great noses and rapacious(贪婪的) eyes, who wore their clothes as though they were armor; and of little, mouse-like spinsters(老处女), with soft voices and a shrewd glance. I never ceased to be fascinated by their persistence in eating buttered toast with their gloves on, and I observed with admiration the unconcern with which they wiped their fingers on their chair when they thought no one was looking. It must have been bad for the furniture, but I suppose the hostess took her revenge on the furniture of her friends when, in turn, she visited them. 

Some of **them** were dressed fashionably, and they said they couldn’t **for the life of them** see why you should be dowdy(不修边幅的) just because you had written a novel; if you had a neat figure you might as well make the most of it, and a smart shoe on a small foot had never prevented an editor from taking your “stuff”. But others thought this frivolous(轻佻的), and they wore “art fabrics” and barbaric jewelry. The men were seldom eccentric in appearance. They tried to look as little like authors as possible. They wished to be taken for men of the world, and could have passed anywhere for the managing clerks of a city firm. They always seemed a little tired. I had never known writers before, and I found them very strange, but I do not think they ever seemed to me quite real.

	them即指前文提到的那些女人。
	「for the life of them」在这里是加深「couldn’t see」的程度，可以理解为“用一生都无法明白”。
	dowdy: a dowdy woman is not attractive, because she wears dull and unfashionable clothes（妇女）穿着单调过时。这是与前面的「dressed fashionably」相对比，用现在的话来讲就是“衣品太差”~

	整句大意：有些人扮相时髦，照她们的话讲，压根不明白为什么会有了作品就没了衣品。


I remember that I thought their conversation brilliant, and I used to listen with astonishment to the **stinging** humor with **which** they would tear a brother-author to pieces the moment that his back was turned. 

	sting: a sharp pain in your eyes or skin, caused by being hit, by smoke etc刺痛，剧痛。stinging humor即指尖酸刻薄的幽默。
	which引导的句子即是指尖酸刻薄的方式，即tear a brother-author to pieces; tear sb. / sth. to shreds / pieces : criticize someone or something very severely严厉批评某人/某物。

	that引导的句子是对moment的修饰，即转身的时候(back was turned)。

	整句大意：我总是惊讶不已地听着他们那尖酸刻薄的幽默话，他们中的一个同行刚一转身，他们就会把他批评得体无完肤。

The artist has this advantage over the rest of the world, that his friends offer not only their appearance and their character to his satire(讥讽), but also their work. I despaired of ever expressing myself with such aptness or with such fluency. 

In those days conversation was still **cultivated** as an art; a neat **repartee**(机敏的应答) was more highly valued than **the crackling(劈啪作响) of thorns under a pot**; and the epigram(名言警句), not yet a mechanical appliance by which the dull may achieve a semblance(表象) of wit, gave sprightliness(活力) to the small talk of the urbane(儒雅的人). 

	cultivate在这里是“培养，栽培”的意思。在文中即指谈话被当做是需要培养的一种艺术。

	「a neat repartee」意思是“简洁的巧妙回答”；其中repartee指conversation which is fast and full of intelligent and amusing remarks and replies机智而巧妙的应对（回答）。「crackling of thorns」意思是“荆棘的爆炸声”。

	​后半句话取自《圣经》旧约传道书第七章：“愚昧人的笑声，好像锅下烧荆棘的爆声。”圣经传道书中说Like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless. 另外参考传道书上一句It is better to heed the rebuke of a wise person than to listen to the song of fools. 宁听智者责骂，不听愚者歌唱。

	整句大意：在那个时代谈话仍然被看作是一种需要陶冶的艺术，一句巧妙的对答比锅子底下噼啪爆响的荆棘更受人赏识

	毛姆这句用典一方面是说他年轻时认为上文提到的尖刻言论属于智者责骂，必然有益，另一方面指出他如今的观点——背后“撕人”逞一时口舌之快毫无意义。这句话老师也是觉得非常正确呐~ 可以敢说，但更要会说。

It is sad that I can remember nothing of all this scintillation(妙言隽语). But I think the conversation never settled down so comfortably as when it turned to the details of the trade which was the other side of the art we practiced. When we had done discussing the merits of the latest book, it was natural to wonder how many copies had been sold, what advance the author had received, and how much he was likely to make out of it. 

Then we would speak of this publisher and **of that**, comparing the generosity of one with the meanness of another; we would argue whether it was better to go to one who gave handsome royalties or to another who “pushed” a book for all it was worth. 

	「of that」前面的动词仍然是speak，that后面省略了publisher。即我们会谈论这个或那个出版商。

	「the generosity of one & the meanness of another」即“慷慨的人&吝啬的人”这里用两个相同的句式形成鲜明的对比，以及用两个相同的we would句式来陳述观点（类似于排比手法的作用，但排比句需要三个及以上的相同句式），使得行文十分工整呢~大家可以多多尝试这样的写作方法哦~

	两个who引导的句子分别用来修饰前面的one和another都是指publisher。其中handsome 指“可观的”royalty指“版税”，连在一起可以理解为“稿酬丰厚”。

	这里的push可以理解为“推广”，for all it was worth字面意思是“它所值得的一切”，也就是说把书在尽可能的更大范围内推广。

	整句大意：然后我们就要谈到这个、那个出版商，比较一下这个人的慷慨和那个人的吝啬。我们还要争辩一下是把槁件交给这一个稿酬优厚的人还是那一个会做宣传、善于推销的人。


Some advertised badly and some well. Some were modern and some were old-fashioned. Then we would talk of agents and the offers they had obtained for us; of editors and the sort of contributions they welcomed, how much they paid a thousand, and whether they paid promptly or otherwise. To me it was all very romantic. It gave me an intimate sense of being a member of some mystic(神秘的) brotherhood(兄弟会).

No one was kinder to me at that time than Rose Waterford.

She combined a masculine intelligence with a feminine perversity(任性), and the novels she wrote were original and disconcerting(令人不安的). It was at her house one day that I met Charles Strickland’s wife. Miss Waterford was giving a tea-party, and her small room was more than usually full. Everyone seemed to be talking, and I, sitting in silence, felt awkward; but I was too shy to break into any of the groups that seemed absorbed in their own affairs. Miss Waterford was a good hostess, and seeing my embarrassment came up to me.

“I want you to talk to Mrs. Strickland,” she said.

“She’s raving about your book. ”

“What does she do?” I asked.

I was conscious of my ignorance, and if Mrs. Strickland was a well-known writer I thought it as well to ascertain the fact before I spoke to her.

Rose Waterford cast down her eyes demurely(庄重地) to give greater effect to her reply.

“She gives luncheon-parties. You’ve only got to roar a little, and she’ll ask you.”

	roar 原意是“咆哮，放声大笑”，在上文我们知道“我”是一个非常低调不爱说话的人，所以这里的roar即指多说话，甚至是说点大话的意思。

	ask不仅有“要求”的意思，还可以表示to invite someone to your home, to go out with you etc邀请。

	整句大意：她专门招待人吃午餐。你只要别那么害羞，多吹嘘自己几句，她准会邀请你（去吃饭的）。

Rose Waterford was a cynic. She looked upon life as an opportunity for writing novels and the public as her raw material. Now and then she invited members of it to her house if they showed an appreciation of her talent and entertained with proper lavishness(慷慨). She held their **weakness for** lions in good-humored contempt, but played to them her part of the distinguished woman of letters with decorum(礼貌得体).

	「weakness for」: if you have a weakness for something, you like it very much对某事的癖好； 
	lions: 著名的人物；名人：文学狮子。这种用法在平时生活中不太常见。
	「weakness for lions」连起来在这里理解为“对作家名人的崇拜”。

	play: behave in a particular way in a situation, in order to achieve the result or effect that you want（以某种方式）表现，行事。这里就是指文人名人间的聚会应酬时的表现。

	这里的letters即指文学，可以理解为是以小见大的方法~ 「of letters with decorum」修饰前面的woman，即端庄得体的女作家风度

	整句大意：这些人对作家的崇拜热让她感到又好笑(good-humored)又鄙夷(contempt)，但是她却同他们周旋应酬表现出(played)一个有名望的(distinguished)女作家的礼貌得体(decorum)。


I was led up to Mrs. Strickland, and for ten minutes we talked together. I noticed nothing about her except that she had a pleasant voice. She had a flat in Westminster, overlooking the unfinished cathedral, and because we lived in the same neighborhood we felt friendly disposed to one another. **The Army and Navy Stores** are a bond of union between all who dwell between the river and **St. James’s Park**. Mrs. Strickland asked me for my address, and a few days later I received an invitation to luncheon.

	The Army and Navy Stores & St. James’s Park.
	今天的阅读讲到对于住在泰晤士河和圣杰姆斯公园之间的人来说，陆海军商店好像是一个把他们联结起来的纽带。也就是找一个共同的话题“陆海军商店”来交流，然后拉近距离~

	The Army and Navy Stores（陆军和海军商店）是英国的一个百货公司，起源于十九世纪的军事合作社。20世纪30年代，成为有限公司。

	St. James’s Park（圣詹姆斯公园）位于伦敦西敏市圣詹姆斯区的南缘，占地23公顷，在伦敦御苑中历史最为悠久。

My engagements were few, and I was glad to accept. When I arrived, a little late, because in my fear of being too early I had walked three times round the cathedral, I found the party already complete. Miss Waterford was there and Mrs. Jay, Richard Twining, and George Road. We were all writers. It was a fine day, early in spring, and we were in a good humor. We talked about a hundred things. 

Miss Waterford, torn between the estheticism(审美观) of her early youth, when she used to go to parties in sage green(灰绿色), holding a daffodil(水仙花), and the flippancy of her maturer(更成熟的) years, which tended to high heels and Paris frocks, wore a new hat. 

	「torn between...and...」 在……之间徘徊。整理一下既是torn between the estheticism of her early youth and the flippancy of her maturer years. 即Miss Waterford在打扮青春一点还是成熟一点之间犹豫不决。

	when引导的句子是修饰前面的early youth，即她以前去派对都是穿(in)灰绿色的服装(sage green)，并且拿一支水仙花(daffodil)。

	which引导的句子修饰「maturer years」，即稍微成熟一点的打扮就需要穿高跟鞋，披着巴黎式的上衣。
	
	「wore a new hat」是指Miss Waterford犹豫的结果。其实整个句子的结构是Miss Waterford (torn between ... and...) wore a new hat.

	flippancy: 原意是“坦率的，无理的”，它在运用中不一定是消极含义（但通常是含贬义）。这里可以理解为Waterford年轻的时候关心她的外表，但现在她成熟了，觉得该有点成熟的样子了。因为中英两种语言始终存在一些差异，我们在阅读时切忌不要把单词一一对应来翻译，要结合语境来理解这些在中文里看起来比较奇怪的搭配哦~

	整句大意：Miss Waterford犹豫不决，是照她更年轻时的唯美主义(estheticism)装扮，身着灰绿，手拿一支水仙花去赴宴呢，还是表现出一点成熟的样子(flippancy)；（如果是后者）那就要穿上高跟鞋(high heels)、披着巴黎式的上衣了。（犹豫了半天）结果只戴了一顶新帽子。

	这是多少女生出门前的“大戏”呀~ O(∩_∩)O哈哈~

It put her in high spirits. I had never heard her more malicious(刻薄的) about our common friends. Mrs. Jay, aware that impropriety(污言秽语) is the soul of wit, made observations in tones hardly above a whisper that might well have tinged(给...染色) the snowy table-cloth with a rosy(粉红的) hue(色调). Richard Twining bubbled over with quaint absurdities(荒唐的言论), and George Road, conscious that he need not exhibit a brilliancy(才智) which was almost a byword(众所周知的事), opened his mouth only to put food into it. Mrs. Strickland did not talk much, but she had a pleasant gift for keeping the conversation general; and when there was a pause she threw in just the right remark to set it going once more. She was a woman of thirty-seven, rather tall，and plump, without being fat; she was not pretty, but her face was pleasing, chiefly, perhaps, on account of her kind brown eyes. Her skin was rather sallow(蜡黄的). Her dark hair was elaborately dressed. She was the only woman of the three whose face was free of make-up, and by contrast with the others she seemed simple and unaffected.
