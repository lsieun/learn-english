一对贫穷的小夫妻圣诞前夜互赠礼物，阴差阳错，两人珍贵的礼物都变成了无用的东西，但他们却得到了比任何实物都宝贵的东西——爱。

Chapter 16

The Gift of the Magi

One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing(强迫) the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation(责备) of parsimony(吝啬) that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.

	「penny」（美国或加拿大的）一分钱硬币，<pennies（用复数）: a coin that is worth one CENT in the US or Canada. One hundred pennies are equal to $1>。
	「bulldoze」强迫（~ sb. into doing）。
	「butcher」屠夫。
	「imputation」归罪，动词impute意思是“归咎（于）归罪（于）， impute sth. to sb.「parsimony」小气，过分吝啬。
	开篇就讲到了一元八角七分，这一句有进一步描述了其中的六角，从中可以看出，故事的主角是生活比较拮据的人：其中有六角钱都是一分一分凑出来的。这些钱都是每次在杂货店、蔬菜摊、肉店和店主讨价还价一分两分攒来的，这番砍价计显得很小气，让人满面通红、羞愧难当。
	故事以这样的方式开头，让读者充满好奇，1.87美元能买什么礼物呢？

There was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates(使发生) the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles(抽噎), and smiles, with sniffles predominating(占支配地位).

While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding(趋于平静) from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the look-out for the mendicancy(乞讨者) squad.

	「subside」（感情）平息、缓和。
	「beggar description」无法形容
	「mendicancy squad」专指逮捕乞丐和流浪汉的警察，
	「be on the look-out for」密切留意、寻找。
	《麦琪的礼物》这一篇有一个很大的特点，就是作者会干预故事的叙述，让读者有种听故事的感觉。比如这一句，欧亨利就讲起了旁白：现在，屋子的女主人情绪慢慢平息，从伤感平静下来，那让我们来看一看这个屋子吧。这套带家具的屋子一周租金是八美元。虽然这间屋子不是破旧到难以描述，但着实要提防那些专门抓乞丐的警察找上门来。看来这间确实屋子颇为破旧。


In the vestibule(门厅) below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax(摆弄好) a ring. Also appertaining(附属物) thereunto(到其上) was a card bearing the name “Mr. James Dillingham Young.”

The “Dillingham” had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of “Dillingham” looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called “Jim” and greatly hugged by Mrs.James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.

Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. To-morrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn’t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling—something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.

There was a pier-glass(穿衣镜) between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal(纵向的) strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.

	「agile」敏捷的，机敏的。「longitudinal」长度的，纵向的。

	一个非常瘦小而灵巧的人，观察自己一连串的纵条影像，可能会对自己的容貌得到一个大致精确的概念。Della身材苗条，已精通了这门艺术。

	文中提到的是一种非常便宜的劣质镜子。

Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.

Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride.

One was Jim’s gold watch that had been his father’s and his grandfather’s. The other was Della’s hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft(通风井), Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate(贬低) Her Majesty’s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor(门房), with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.

	「airshaft」通风井，天井。「depreciate」使…贬值。「janitor」守门人「pluck at sth.」（用手指）猛揪（拉，扯）。
	文中用了两位圣经中的人物，很巧妙的是这两个人也是夫妻，此外看完简介后大家就更好理解文中为什么会提到他们了~ 「the Queen of Sheba」示巴女王，在希伯来圣经记载中，是一位统治非洲东部示巴王国的女王。以美貌著称。根据《旧约圣经》列王纪上第10章、《古兰经》和阿克苏姆国的其他历史资料的记载，她因为仰慕当时以色列国王所罗门的才华与智慧，不惜纡尊降贵，前往以色列向所罗门提亲。「King Solomon」所罗门。根据《希伯来圣经》的记载，他曾是以色列耶路撒冷的一代帝王，后来在《古兰经》中，他被称为先知。《旧约全书·列王记》中有这样一段记载：公元前10世纪中期，以色列王国在国王所罗门的治理下，国泰民安，十分兴盛，特别是他花了20年时间建造金碧辉煌的耶和华圣殿和王宫，更是使他驰名遐迩。下面这张画名为《示巴女王会见所罗门王》。

	这两句都是虚拟语态的倒装句序，先把语序调整过来：If the queen of Shaba had lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair......；If King Solomon had been the janitor, Jim would have pulled out his watch...。

	如果示巴女王也住在天井对面的公寓里，总有一天Della会把头发披散下来，露出窗外晾干，使那女王的珍珠宝贝暗然失色；如果地下室堆满金银财宝、所罗门王又是守门人的话，每当吉姆路过那儿，准会摸出金表，好让那所罗门王忌妒得吹胡子瞪眼睛。可见这两件宝贝多么的出众~

So now Della’s beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like a cascade(小瀑布) of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered(犹豫) for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.

On went her old brown jacket. On went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.

Where she stopped the sign read: “Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds. ” One **flight** up Della ran, and **collected herself**, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the “Sofronie.”

	 「flight」一段楼梯。「collect oneself」尽力镇静下来，整理思绪。

	Della来到一个招牌前停下，招牌上写着：“Sofronie.专买各种头发。”原来Della想卖掉她的秀发换钱啊。Della跑上一段楼梯，喘了喘气，让自己平静下来。眼前的Sofronie女士块头很大，肤色很白（Sofronie这个名字颇具异域风情，too white是说这位女士看起来不像是从外国来的），看起来冷冰冰的，与Sofronie這個名字不太搭調

“Will you buy my hair?” asked Della.

“I buy hair,” said Madame.

“Take yer hat off and let’s have a sight at the looks of it.”

Down rippled the brown cascade.

“Twenty dollars,” said Madame, lifting the mass with a practized hand.

“Give it to me quick,” said Della.

Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed(杂凑的) metaphor. She was ransacking(搜寻) the stores for Jim’s present.

She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum(白金) fob chain simple and chaste(朴实的) in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious(花哨的) ornamentation—as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim’s. It was like him. Quietness and value—the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly(背地里，偷偷) on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.

	「chaste」朴素的。「meretricious」庸俗的。

	原来Della看中的礼物是一条白金表链（a platinum fob chain）：单单这简洁朴素的设计就能彰显出表链的价值，所有的好东西都是这样——只靠本质而不需浮夸庸俗的装饰来显示价值。The Watch在这里特指Jim的金表。Della看到的这条表链与Jim的金表搭配，堪称完美。

	欧亨利谈到的这一条关于价值的真理仍然管用，真材实料往往比包装来得重要，可不能金玉其外、败絮其中啊～

	「anxious」渴望的（这里不是“紧张的”的意思哦～）「on the sly」悄悄地、偷偷地。

	这句话仍然是在描写这条表链，有了这条表链后，Jim在任何情况下都能抬起手腕看时间了。第二句是一个as引导的让步用法，句子倒装了。意思就是尽管Jim有一块好表，由于用了一条老旧的皮带子代替表链，他有时也只能偷偷地看一眼时间。

When Della reached home her intoxication(陶醉) gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages(毁坏后的残迹) made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends—a mammoth(极其巨大的) task.

Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant(逃学的) schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.

“If Jim doesn’t kill me,” she said to herself, “before he takes a second look at me, he’ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do—oh! What could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?”

At seven o’clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.

Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: “Please God, make him think I am still pretty.”

The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two—and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.

Jim stepped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail(鹌鹑). His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.

Della wriggled(扭动) off the table and went for him.

“Jim, darling,” she cried, “don’t look at me that way.

I had my hair cut off and sold it because I couldn’t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present.

It’ll grow out again—you won’t mind, will you? I just had to do it.

My hair grows awfully fast.

Say ‘Merry Christmas!’ Jim, and let’s be happy.

You don’t know what a nice—what a beautiful, nice gift I’ve got for you. ”

“You’ve cut off your hair?” asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.

“Cut it off and sold it,” said Della.

“Don’t you like me just as well, anyhow? I’m me without my hair, ain’t I?”

Jim looked about the room curiously.

“You say your hair is gone?” He said with an air almost of idiocy.

“You needn’t look for it,” said Della.

“It’s sold, I tell you—sold and gone, too.

It’s Christmas Eve, boy.

Be good to me, for it went for you.

Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,” she went on with sudden serious sweetness, “but nobody could ever count my love for you.

Shall I put the chops on, Jim?”

Out of his trance(恍惚) Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded(拥抱) his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential(微不足道的) object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year—what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.

	「discreet」审慎的，谨慎的。「scrutiny」仔细的观察。「inconsequential」微不足道的。「wit」机智的人
	 这一段又是作者对文本的干预，Jim和Della在拥抱的时候，这位讲故事的人又出现了，给大家来了个小小的剧透：让我们花10秒钟换个方向仔细审视一些不太重要的小事情。一周赚八美元，一年赚一百万，这两个有什么区别呢？要是让数学家或是聪明人回答这个问题，他们也会答错。麦琪带来了珍贵的礼物，但钱财不是最主要的。这句难懂的话后面会得到解释。
	But that was not among them这句中的that指的是上文提到的money，背景介绍中讲到，来自东方的三贤人在圣婴基督出生时为他献上三份礼物，分别是金子，乳香和没药，这三份礼物的价值不可用金钱来衡量。礼物讲究心意而不是单纯的价格。

Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.

“Don’t make any mistake, Dell,” he said, “about me.

I don’t think there’s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo(洗发水) that could make me like my girl any less.

But if you’ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going awhile at first. ”

White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic(狂喜的) scream of joy; and then, alas! A quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails(恸哭), necessitating(使成为必要) the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.

	「ecstatic」狂喜的，兴奋的。「hysterical」歇斯底里的。「necessitate」使...成为必要，需要。

	这一段话细腻生动地描写出了Della打开Jim礼物后的变化，也成功地埋下了一个伏笔，激起了读者的好奇：打开盒子后，Della兴奋高兴地喊出了声，可是，天呐！突然就变成了女性神经质的痛哭，急需男主人使出浑身解数加以安慰。这里的lord of the flat指的就是男主人Jim。

For there lay The Combs—the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure **tortoise shell**(玳瑁壳), with jeweled rims(边缘)—just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.

	Tortoise Shell 玳瑁
	玳瑁，有时也称龟甲，在宝石学中被归类为有机宝石，特指玳瑁（一种海龟）的背甲，为非晶质体。玳瑁宝石呈微透明至半透明，具蜡质至油脂光泽，玳瑁饰品高贵典雅，有祥瑞幸福、健康长寿的象征，享有“海金”之称。
	很多文化中都有玳瑁工艺品的使用。在西方，玳瑁被古希腊和古罗马人用于制作梳子、刷子和戒指等首饰；古埃及、古希腊和古罗马人会将玳瑁镶嵌在家具上。汉代遗址和努比亚人统治时代的埃及古墓中就曾发现过很多精美的玳瑁器。
	文中Jim送给Della的一套梳子就是玳瑁梳子，可见其珍贵程度。

But she hugged them to her bosom(怀里), and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: “My hair grows so fast, Jim!”

And then Della leaped up like a little singed(被火烧着的) cat and cried, “Oh, oh!”

Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.

“Isn’t it a dandy(最好的东西), Jim? I hunted all over town to find it.

You’ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now.

Give me your watch.

I want to see how it looks on it. ”

Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.

“Dell,” said he, “let’s put our Christmas presents away and keep ’em awhile.

They’re too nice to use just at present.

I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs.

And now suppose you put the chops on. ”

The magi, as you know, were wise men—wonderfully wise men—who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger(（马槽里的婴儿）指耶稣). They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle(叙述) of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days, let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.

	「relate」讲述。「uneventful」平淡无奇的。「chronicle」编年史，此处可以理解为故事。
	作者先是欲扬先抑地说：“我已经笨拙地给你们介绍了住公寓套间的两个傻孩子不足为奇的平淡故事，他们极不明智地为了对方而牺牲了他们家最最宝贵的东西。”但后面又接着说：“但我要对现在的聪明人说句话，在所有送礼物的人中，Della和Jim是最明智的。在一切馈赠又接收礼品的人当中，像他们两个这样的人也是最聪明的。无论在何处，他们都是最聪明的人。”
	因为他们就是麦琪。是智慧，是爱。这段话，点明了这篇文章的主题。

这个故事讲述了一对穷困的年轻夫妇忍痛割爱互赠圣诞礼物的故事，反映了美国下层人民生活的艰难，赞美了主人公善良的心地和纯真爱情。Della和Jim即使只是生活在社会底层的小人物，却拥有着对生活的热情和对彼此的深爱，在这些温暖的感情面前，贫困可以变得微不足道。虽然最终彼此的礼物对于对方而言已失去使用价值，但是他们却得到了人世间比礼物更宝贵的东西，那就是无价的爱。

圣诞节是基督教纪念耶稣降生的节日，西方基督教通常将此节日定于12月25日。

Magi 东方三国王，这里指的是Biblical Magi
东方三国王（希腊语：μάγοι；拉丁转写：magoi），又称东方三贤士、三智者、麦琪等，是艺术作品和基督教刊物经常提到，出现在许多与圣诞节有关的画像里面的人物。一般会与耶稣和其父母、牧羊人，以及马厩中的动物一同出现。根据《新约圣经·马太福音》第2章第1－12节的记载，来自东方的三贤人在圣婴基督出生时为他献上三份礼物，分别是金子，乳香（frankincense，尤用于宗教仪式）和没药（myrrh，用于制香水和熏香）
