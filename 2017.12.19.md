Previous Story

作家因自己的第一本书而广受关注，在刚进入伦敦文学圈时惴惴不安，在一次次的宴会中对于社会名流装腔作势附庸风雅的势态感到不可思议。之后在Waterford小姐的宴会上初识了Mrs. Strickland，并且受邀去参加了午宴。

Chapter 4

The dining-room was in the good taste of the period. It was very severe. There was a high dado(壁板) of white wood and a green paper on which were etchings(铜版画) by Whistler in neat black frames. The green curtains with their peacock(孔雀) design, hung in straight lines, and the green carpet, in the pattern of which pale rabbits frolicked(嬉戏) among leafy trees, suggested the influence of William Morris. There was blue delft(代尔夫特精陶) on the chimneypiece(壁炉台). At that time there must have been five hundred dining-rooms in London decorated in exactly the same manner. It was chaste(简洁的), artistic, and dull.

When we left I walked away with Miss Waterford, and the fine day and her new hat persuaded us to saunter(漫步) through the Park.

“That was a very nice party,” I said.

“Did you think the food was good? I told her that if she wanted writers she must feed them well. ”

“Admirable advice,” I answered.

“But why does she want them?”

Miss Waterford shrugged her shoulders.

“She finds them amusing.

She wants to be in the movement.

I fancy she’s rather simple, poor dear, and she thinks we’re all wonderful.

After all, it pleases her to ask us to luncheon, and it doesn’t hurt us.

I like her for it.”

Looking back, I think that Mrs. Strickland was the most harmless of all the lion-hunters that pursue their quarry(猎物) from the rarefied(曲高和寡的) heights of Hampstead to the nethermost(寒酸的) studios of Cheyne Walk. She had led a very quiet youth in the country, and the books that came down from Mudie’s Library brought with them not only their own romance, but the romance of London. She had a real passion for reading (rare in her kind, who for the most part are more interested in the author than in his book, in the painter than in his pictures), and she invented a world of the imagination in which she lived with a freedom she never acquired in the world of every day. When she came to know writers it was like adventuring upon a stage which till then she had known only from the other side of the footlights(脚灯). She saw them dramatically, and really seemed herself to live a larger life because she entertained them and visited them in their fastnesses(堡垒). She accepted the rules with which they played the game of life as valid for them,but never for a moment thought of regulating her own conduct in accordance with(依据) them. Their moral eccentricities, like their oddities of dress, their wild theories and paradoxes, were an entertainment which amused her, but had not the slightest influence on her convictions.

“Is there a Mr. Strickland?” I asked.

“Oh yes; he’s something in the city.

I believe he’s a stockbroker(股票经纪人).

He’s very dull.”

“Are they good friends?”

“They adore one another.

You’ll meet him if you dine there.

But she doesn’t often have people to dinner.

He’s very quiet.

He’s not in the least interested in literature or the arts.”

“Why do nice women marry dull men?”

“Because intelligent men won’t marry nice women.”

I could not think of any retort to this, so I asked if Mrs. Strickland had children.

“Yes; she has a boy and a girl.

They’re both at school.” 

The subject was exhausted, and we began to talk of other things.

During the summer I met Mrs. Strickland not infrequently. I went now and then to pleasant little luncheons at her flat, and to rather more formidable tea-parties. We took a fancy to one another. I was very young, and perhaps she liked the idea of guiding my virgin steps on the hard road of letters; while for me it was pleasant to have someone I could go to with my small troubles, certain of an attentive ear and reasonable counsel. Mrs. Strickland had the gift of sympathy. It is a charming faculty, but one often abused by those who are conscious of its possession: for there is something ghoulish(可怕的) in the avidity with which they will pounce(猛扑) upon the misfortune of their friends so that they may exercise their dexterity(技巧). It gushes(喷出) forth like an oil-well, and the sympathetic pour out their sympathy with an abandon that is sometimes embarrassing to their victims. There are bosoms(胸膛) on which so many tears have been shed that I cannot bedew(沾湿) them with mine. Mrs. Strickland used her advantage with tact. You felt that you obliged her by accepting her sympathy. When, in the enthusiasm of my youth, I remarked on this to Rose Waterford, she said:

“Milk is very nice, especially with a drop of brandy in it, but the domestic cow is only too glad to be rid of it.

A swollen udder(乳房) is very uncomfortable.”

Rose Waterford had a blistering tongue. No one could say such bitter things; on the other hand, no one could do more charming ones.

There was another thing I liked in Mrs. Strickland. She managed her surroundings with elegance. Her flat was always neat and cheerful, gay with flowers, and the chintzes(印花窗帘) in the drawing-room, notwithstanding their severe design, were bright and pretty. The meals in the artistic little dining-room were pleasant; the table looked nice, the two maids were trim and comely(标致的), the food was well cooked. It was impossible not to see that Mrs. Strickland was an excellent housekeeper. And you felt sure that she was an admirable mother. There were photographs in the drawing-room of her son and daughter. The son—his name was Robert—was a boy of sixteen at Rugby; and you saw him in flannels and a cricket cap, and again in a tail-coat and a stand-up collar. He had his mother’s candid(白净的) brow and fine, reflective eyes. He looked clean, healthy, and normal.

“I don’t know that he’s very clever,” she said one day,

when I was looking at the photograph, “but I know he’s good.
He has a charming character.”

The daughter was fourteen. Her hair, thick and dark like her mother’s, fell over her shoulders in fine profusion(大量), and she had the same kindly expression and sedate(从容的), untroubled eyes.

“They’re both of them the image of you,” I said.

“Yes; I think they are more like me than their father.”

“Why have you never let me meet him?” I asked.

“Would you like to?”

She smiled, her smile was really very sweet, and she blushed a little; it was singular that a woman of that age should flush so readily. Perhaps her naïveté was her greatest charm.

“You know, he’s not at all literary,” she said.

“He’s a perfect philistine(庸俗的人).”

She said this not disparagingly(贬损地), but affectionately(深情地) rather, as though, by acknowledging the worst about him, she wished to protect him from the aspersions(中伤) of her friends.

“He’s on the Stock Exchange, and he’s a typical broker.

I think he’d bore you to death.”

“Does he bore you?” I asked.

“You see, I happen to be his wife.

I’m very fond of(喜欢) him.”

She smiled to cover her shyness, and I fancied she had a fear that I would make the sort of gibe(嘲弄) that such a confession could hardly have failed to elicit from Rose Waterford. She hesitated a little. Her eyes grew tender.

“He doesn’t pretend to be a genius.

He doesn’t even make much money on the Stock Exchange.

But he’s awfully good and kind.”

“I think I should like him very much.”

“I’ll ask you to dine with us quietly some time, but mind, you come at your own risk; don’t blame me if you have a very dull evening.”
