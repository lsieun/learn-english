Night had fallen on that great and beautiful city known as **Bagdad-on-the-Subway**. And with the night came the **enchanted** **glamor** that belongs not to **Arabia** alone. In different **masquerade**(掩饰的外观) the streets, **bazaars** and walled houses of the occidental(西方的) city of romance were filled with the same kind of folk that so much interested our interesting old friend, the **late** Mr. H. A. Rashid. They wore clothes eleven hundred years nearer to the latest styles that H. A. saw in the old **Bagdad**; but they were about the same people underneath.

“Lock ’em up,” ordered the sergeant.

In his cell, James Turner laid himself on his cot(简易床), ruminating(沉思). “Maybe he’s got the money and maybe he ain’t. But if he has or he ain’t what does he want to go ’round butting into(干涉，插手) other folks’s business for? When a man knows what he wants, and can get it, it’s the same as $40,000,000 to him. ”

Then an idea came to him that brought a pleased look to his face.

He removed his socks, drew his cot close to the door, stretched himself out luxuriously, and placed his tortured feet against the cold bars of the cell door.
