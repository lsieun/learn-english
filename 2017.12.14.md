感恩节这天，两位绅士为了一个九年的默契和约定，分别撒了一个善意的谎言，上演了一出耐人寻味的剧情...

Chapter 15

Two Thanksgiving Day Gentleman

There is one day that is ours. There is one day when all we Americans who are not self-made go back to the old home to eat saleratus biscuits and marvel how much nearer to the porch the old pump looks than it used to. Bless the day. **President Roosevelt gives it to us**. **We hear some talk of the Puritans(清教徒), but don’t just remember who they were. Bet we can lick ’em, anyhow, if they try to land again. Plymouth Rocks?** Well, that sounds more familiar. **Lots of us have had to come down to hens since the Turkey Trust got its work in. But somebody in Washington is leaking out advance information to ’em about these Thanksgiving proclamations(公告)**.

	「leak out」（秘密、消息）泄露，走漏。
	「trust」托拉斯（企业为减少竞争、操纵价格而非法形成的组织）文中这个Turkey Trust不是指当时火鸡价格真的被垄断了，而是表达感恩节火鸡价格昂贵，比一般的鸡贵多了。此外老罗斯福在位期间，大力打击垄断。「Thanksgiving proclamations」美国总统会在每年感恩节发表的演讲。
	这句话的意思颇具幽默意味：火鸡太昂贵了，很多人只能买母鸡来过节。自林肯总统起，每年感恩节总统都会发表感恩节声明，这对于民众来说早已不是惊喜了。但是华盛顿一些人泄密了老罗斯福总统在感恩节要发表的演讲信息，因为老罗斯福打击垄断，所以商贩会乘此之前将火鸡价格提高，人们更买不起了。

The big city east of the cranberry(蔓越橘) bogs has made Thanksgiving Day an institution. **The last Thursday in November is the only day in the year on which it recognizes the part of America lying across the ferries**. It is the one day that is purely American. Yes, a day of celebration, exclusively American.

	感恩节 The Thanksgiving Day
	感恩节（Thanksgiving Day）是美国人民独创的一个古老节日，也是美国人合家欢聚的节日。初时感恩节没有固定日期，由美国各州临时决定。直到美国独立后的1863年，林肯总统宣布感恩节为全国性节日，当时的感恩节是十一月的最后一个星期四。所以今天文中提到一句“The last Thursday in November is the only day in the year on which it recognizes the part of America lying across the ferries.”因为本文的创作时间在20世纪之交。此句中的it - The big city east of the cranberry bogs，指的就是纽约。但1941年的十一月有5个星期四，所以当时美国国会正式将每年11月第四个星期四定为“感恩节”。

	说到感恩节，就一定要提一提这个节日的背景了，文中有两个地方就与感恩节的背景相关——“We hear some talk of the Puritans, but don’t just remember who they were. Bet we can lick ’em, anyhow, if they try to land again.”和“Plymouth Rock”。感恩节的由来可以追溯到美国历史的发端，起源于马萨诸塞普利茅斯的早期移民。Plymouth Rock，普利茅斯岩石在马萨诸塞州普利茅斯港口，相传为首批清教徒登陆之处，但其实，登陆地点是普罗文斯敦的科德角。

	这些移民在英国本土时被称为清教徒（Puritans），因为他们对英国教会的宗教改革不彻底感到不满，以及英王及英国教会对他们的政治镇压和宗教迫害，所以这些清教徒脱离英国教会，远走荷兰，后来决定迁居到大西洋彼岸那片荒无人烟的土地上，希望能按照自己的意愿信教自由地生活。1620年，著名的“五月花”号船满载不堪忍受英国国内宗教迫害的102名清教徒到达美洲。1620年和1621年之交的冬天，他们遇到了当地原住民送来了生活必需品，还特地派人教他们怎样狩猎、捕鱼和种植玉米、南瓜。在印第安人的帮助下，移民们终于获得了丰收，在欢庆丰收的日子，按照宗教传统习俗，移民规定了感谢上帝的日子，并决定为感谢印第安人的真诚帮助，邀请他们一同庆祝节日。

	President Roosevelt gives it to us.
	这里提到的罗斯福不是富兰克林罗斯福哦，这里的罗斯福总统指西奥多·罗斯福（Theodore Roosevelt, 1858～1919），昵称泰迪（Teddy），所以人们也叫他Teddy Roosevelt，在任期为1901年 – 1909年，人称老罗斯福。

	西奥多·罗斯福是总统山上四个总统雕像之中唯一的20世纪总统，与乔治·华盛顿、托马斯·杰斐逊和亚伯拉罕·林肯并驾齐驱。

	文中提到“President Roosevelt gives it to us.”，这句话的背景是这样的：1901年总统威廉·麦金莱（William McKinley, 1843－1901）被无政府主义者刺杀身亡，总统西奥多•罗斯福在总统办公室（Oval Office）签署他的第一份声明，号召美国人民表达感恩。声明原文：Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, do hereby designate as a day of general thanksgiving Thursday, the 28th of this present November, and do recommend that throughout the land the people cease from their wonted occupations, and at their several homes and places of worship reverently thank the Giver of all good for the countless blessings of our national life.

	1863年，林肯总统将感恩节定为美国的国家传统，1901年，老罗斯福将其规定为一个美国国家节日，但是直到1941年，富兰克林·罗斯福总统才将感恩节定为一个法定假日。

And now for the story which is to prove to you that we have traditions on this side of the ocean that are becoming older at a much rapider rate than those of England are—thanks to our git-up and enterprise.

	And now for the story / which is to prove to you that / we have traditions on this side of the ocean / that are becoming older at a much rapider rate / than those of England are – thanks to our git-up and enterprise.

	「git-up」活力，干劲。「enterprise」进取心，事业心。

	此文的一个中心词就是传统（traditions），尊敬传统的两位老妇人和希望创造传统的老绅士，传统有着浓浓的历史感和沧桑感，这三位人物就对传统有着执念。

	相对于英国来说，美国是一个年轻的国家，这一句体现出美国试图让自己“变老”，顺便揶揄了一把英国：在大洋此岸的这一方，也有一些日趋古老的传统，并且由于我们的奋发和进取精神，这些传统趋向古老的速度比在英国快得多。

Stuffy Pete took his seat on the third bench to the right as you enter Union Square from the east, at the walk opposite the fountain. Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years he had taken his seat there promptly at one o’clock. **For every time he had done so things had happened to him—Charles Dickensy things that swelled his waistcoat(马甲) above his heart, and equally on the other side**.

	「Dickensian」adj. 这里的Charles Dickensy things尤指狄更斯笔下极端贫穷的生活条件或不公平的社会环境；也讽刺了维多利亚时代人们的生活。其实这个词可以看作是一个小“剧透”：颇为可笑的事情发生在Stuffy身上，他受到了一位老绅士的感恩节资助，但是那位老先生本身也很穷。颇为讽刺。

	「swell」这个词在这里用了两个意思，一个是「one’s heart swell」“某人满心欢喜/自豪”，另一个是“膨胀”，意思就是：九年以来，每个感恩节下午一点左右，Stuffy坐在这长凳上，都会有奇特的事情发生在他身上，让他满心欢喜，又让他吃饱喝足。

But to-day Stuffy Pete’s appearance at the annual trysting(约会) place seemed to have been rather the result of habit than of the yearly hunger which, as the philanthropists(慈善家) seem to think, afflicts the poor at such extended intervals.

Certainly Pete was not hungry. He had just come from a feast that had left him of his powers barely those of respiration(呼吸) and locomotion(移动). His eyes were like two pale gooseberries(醋栗) firmly imbedded in a swollen and gravy-smeared(油水淋漓的) mask of putty(油灰). **His breath came in short wheezes; a senatorial roll of adipose tissue denied a fashionable set to his upturned coat collar. Buttons that had been sewed upon his clothes by kind Salvation fingers a week before flew like popcorn, strewing(撒满) the earth around him. Ragged(衣衫褴褛的) he was, with a split shirt front open to the wishbone; but the November breeze, carrying fine snowflakes, brought him only a grateful coolness.** For Stuffy Pete was overcharged with the caloric(热量的) produced by a super-bountiful dinner, beginning with oysters and ending with plum(李子) pudding, and including (it seemed to him) all the roast turkey and baked potatoes and chicken salad and squash pie and ice cream in the world. Wherefore he sat, gorged(塞饱的), and gazed upon the world with after-dinner contempt.

	「wheeze」气喘声。
	「adipose tissue」脂肪组织。
	「wishbone」是鸟类脖子上形状像Y的一根骨头。吃鸡的时候会吃到。有一个古老风俗，吃到这根骨头时，两个人要比赛，一人一头一起扯，扯到长一点骨头的，就会有好运气，可以许下一个秘密愿望。所以wishbone被叫做“许愿骨”、“如愿骨”。
	 这个感恩节，Stuffy和往常不同，今天的他不是饥寒交迫的状态，明显是饱餐一顿了。他的呼吸声带有短促的喘息，脖子上一圈参议员般的脂肪（古罗马时期的参议员通常很胖，这也是他们财富的象征，这里用了a senatorial roll of adipose tissue来表达Stuffy脖子上一圈肥肉）让翻上来的外衣领子毫无时髦可言。… 他衣衫破旧，衣服一直破到心口，但是十一月夹着雪花的寒风也只是让他感到舒适的凉爽。

The meal had been an unexpected one. He was passing a red brick mansion near the beginning of Fifth Avenue, in which lived two old ladies of ancient family and a reverence(尊重) for traditions. They even denied the existence of New York, and believed that Thanksgiving Day was declared solely for Washington Square. One of their traditional habits was to station a servant at the postern gate with orders to admit the first hungry wayfarer(过路人) that came along after the hour of noon had struck, and banquet him to a finish. Stuffy Pete happened to pass by on his way to the park, and the seneschals(大管家) gathered him in and upheld the custom of the castle.

After Stuffy Pete had gazed straight before him for ten minutes he was conscious of a desire for a more varied field of vision. With a tremendous effort he moved his head slowly to the left. **And then his eyes bulged(鼓起) out fearfully, and his breath ceased, and the rough-shod ends of his short legs wriggled(扭动) and rustled(沙沙作响) on the gravel**.

**For the Old Gentleman was coming across Fourth Avenue toward his bench.**

	「eyes bulge out」瞪大了眼睛。
	「the rough-shod ends of his short legs」shod意思是“穿鞋的”，所以这个表达的意思就是Pete的鞋子很破旧。
	「wriggle」扭动、蠕动。
	「gravel」砾石，石子。
	「established」资深的、确立已久的。
	「bristle up」毛发直立，发怒（狗如果这样，就说明进入了攻击状态）。

	「Santos-Dumont」亚伯托·桑托斯·杜蒙（Alberto Santos-Dumont, 1873－1932），一位巴西航空先驱，1901年乘汽球从法国的圣克卢至埃菲尔铁塔往返飞行一次。

	这两段话生动形象地表达出了饱餐一顿后的Stuffy看到他九年的感恩节恩人到来时的恐惧和慌乱：他的眼球惊恐地鼓了出来，他的呼吸停止了，他那穿着破皮鞋的短脚在砂砾地上簌簌地扭动着。…斯塔弗·皮特眼看他的老恩人走近，不禁呼吸短促，直打哆嗦，正如某位太太那过于肥胖的哈巴狗看到一条野狗对它呲牙竖毛时那样。他很想跳起来逃跑，可是即使桑托斯•杜蒙施展出全部本领，也无法使他同长凳分开。 

Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years the Old Gentleman had come there and found Stuffy Pete on his bench. That was a thing that the Old Gentleman was trying to make a tradition of. Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years he had found Stuffy there, and had led him to a restaurant and watched him eat a big dinner. They do those things in England unconsciously. But this is a young country, and nine years is not so bad. The Old Gentleman was a stanch(忠实的) American patriot, and considered himself a pioneer in American tradition. In order to become picturesque(独创的) we must keep on doing one thing for a long time without ever letting it get away from us. Something like collecting the weekly dimes(十分硬币) in industrial insurance. Or cleaning the streets.

The Old Gentleman moved, straight and stately(庄重地), toward the Institution that he was rearing. **Truly, the annual feeding of Stuffy Pete was nothing national in its character, such as the Magna Charta or jam for breakfast was in England**. But it was a step. It was almost feudal. It showed, at least, that a Custom was not impossible to New Y—ahem!—America.

	Magna Charta and jam for breakfast大宪章与早餐果酱，这两样事物都是满满的英国特色啊~

	Magna Carta Libertatum（自由大宪章），是中世纪拉丁语，即 the Great Charter of the Liberties。是英格兰国王约翰最初于1215年6月15日在温莎附近的兰尼米德订立的拉丁文政治性授权文件。但在随后的版本中将大部分对英国王室绝对权力有直接挑战的条目删除。1225年首次成为法律。1297年的英文版本至今仍然是英格兰威尔士的有效法律。下面这张图展示的是1215年订立的大宪章。

	文中提到“Truly, the annual feeding of Stuffy Pete was nothing national in its character, such as the Magna Charta or jam for breakfast was in England.” 
	当然啦，老绅士一年一度为Stuffy Pete提供的感恩节餐并不像英国的大宪章或者早餐果酱那样具有国家性。

The Old Gentleman was thin and tall and sixty. He was dressed all in black, and wore the old-fashioned kind of glasses that won’t stay on your nose. His hair was whiter and thinner than it had been last year, and he seemed to make more use of his big, knobby(多节的) cane with the crooked handle.

As his established benefactor came up Stuffy wheezed(喘息) and shuddered(发抖) like some woman’s over-fat pug(哈巴狗) when a street dog bristles(毛发竖起) up at him. He would have flown, but all the skills of Santos-Dumont could not have separated him from his bench. Well had the myrmidons(家仆) of the two old ladies done their work.

“Good morning,” said the Old Gentleman.

“I am glad to perceive that the vicissitudes(变迁) of another year have spared you to move in health about the beautiful world.

For that blessing alone this day of thanksgiving is well proclaimed to each of us.

If you will come with me, my man, I will provide you with a dinner that should make your physical being accord with the mental. ”

	「vicissitudes」（持续影响某种局面或个人生活的）改变，变迁，兴衰。
	「accord with」与某事物相符（一致）

	下文提到：Nothing could be compared with them except the Declaration of Independence.九年来，这位老绅士总是说着这段话，能与这段话匹敌的怕是只有《独立宣言》了。《独立宣言》是北美洲十三个英属殖民地宣告自大不列颠王国独立，并宣明此举正当性之文告。1776年7月4日，本宣言由第二次大陆会议于费城批准，当日之后成为美国独立纪念日。宣言之原件由大陆会议出席代表共同签署，并永久展示于美国华盛顿特区之美国国家档案馆。此宣言为美国最重要的立国文书之一。

	那让我们来感受一下老绅士那堪比《独立宣言》的开场白吧：“你好。我很高兴见到，又一年的变迁对你并没有什么影响，你仍旧很健康地在这个美好的世界上逍遥自在。仅仅为了这一点幸福，今天这个感恩节对我们两人都有很大的意义。假如你愿意跟我一起来，朋友，我准备请你吃顿饭，让你的身心取得协调。”

That is what the Old Gentleman said every time. Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years. The words themselves almost formed an Institution. Nothing could be compared with them except the Declaration of Independence. Always before they had been music in Stuffy’s ears. But now he looked up at the Old Gentleman’s face with tearful agony in his own. The fine snow almost sizzled(咝咝作响) when it fell upon his perspiring brow. But the Old Gentleman shivered a little and turned his back to the wind.

Stuffy had always wondered why the Old Gentleman spoke his speech rather sadly. He did not know that it was because he was wishing every time that he had a son to succeed him. A son who would come there after he was gone—a son who would stand proud and strong before some subsequent Stuffy, and say: “In memory of my father.” Then it would be an Institution.

But the Old Gentleman had no relatives. He lived in rented rooms in one of the decayed old family brownstone mansions in one of the quiet streets east of the park. In the winter he raised fuchsias(倒挂金钟) in a little conservatory(温室) the size of a **steamer trunk**. In the spring he walked in the Easter parade. In the summer he lived at a farmhouse in the New Jersey hills, and sat in a wicker armchair, speaking of a butterfly, the ornithoptera amphrisius(鸟翼凤蝶), that he hoped to find some day. In the autumn he fed Stuffy a dinner. These were the Old Gentleman’s occupations.

	「steamer trunk」（可放在船舱床位下的）扁平行李箱。「ornithoptera amphrisius」鸟翼凤蝶
	这段话简要概括了老绅士一年的“工作”： 冬天，他在一个不比衣箱大多少的温室里种些倒挂金钟。春天，他参加复活节的游行。夏天，他在新泽西州山间的农舍里寄宿，坐在柳条扶手椅上，谈着他希望总有一天能找到的某种扑翼蝴蝶。秋天，他请Stuffy吃顿饭。他没有亲戚，在落败的褐色石屋里租了几间房子，看得出来老人的生活并不富足，与前面提到的两位老妇人不能比。

Stuffy Pete looked up at him for half a minute, stewing and helpless in his own self-pity. The Old Gentleman’s eyes were bright with the giving-pleasure. His face was getting more lined each year, but his little black necktie was in as jaunty(俏皮的) a bow as ever, and the linen was beautiful and white, and his gray mustache(胡须) was curled carefully at the ends. And then Stuffy made a noise that sounded like peas bubbling in a pot. Speech was intended; and as the Old Gentleman had heard the sounds nine times before, he rightly construed(理解) them into Stuffy’s old formula of acceptance.

“Thankee, sir.

I’ll go with ye, and much obliged.

I’m very hungry, sir. ”

The coma of repletion(饱食) had not prevented from entering Stuffy’s mind the conviction that he was the basis of an Institution. His Thanksgiving appetite was not his own; it belonged by all the sacred(神圣的) rights of established custom, if not by the actual **Statute of Limitations**, to this kind old gentleman who had preempted(优先占有) it. True, America is free; but in order to establish tradition some one must be a repetend(循环小数)—a repeating decimal. **The heroes are not all heroes of steel and gold. See one here that wielded only weapons of iron, badly silvered, and tin**.

	「Statute of Limitations」诉讼时效法规。英美法律规定，不动产遭受侵害的起诉期限为二十年，动产为六年，犯法行为为二年；超过上述期限后原告不得提出诉讼。用在这里是指，如果有别人想在感恩节这天强占Stuffy的胃口或者Stuffy自己想反抗老绅士，拒绝他请的这餐饭，都是无用功了。当然，这里是个幽默用法。

	Stuffy感恩节的胃口并不属于他自己，而是属于这位占有优先权的慈祥的老先生；因为即使不根据实际的诉讼时效法（Statute of Limitations），也得考虑到既定习俗的全部神圣权利。

	那Pete到底喜不喜欢老先生请的这顿饭呢？上文中提到：Always before they had been music in Stuffy’s ears.曾经老绅士的开场白在Stuffy的耳朵里宛如美妙的音乐，他很喜欢这段开场白，因为听完就可以饱餐一顿了。但今年不同了，今年的Stuffy吃饱了，所以他感觉他的胃不由得他自己掌控，老绅士来了，还是得逢场作戏，讨他开心。

	Stuffy觉得自己又圆了老先生的慷慨之梦，就标榜自己是英雄，幽默意味很深：英雄们不一定非得使用钢铁和黄金（这里是指武器：钢制利剑、镀金盔甲）。不可。瞧，这儿就有一位光是挥弄着马马虎虎地镀了银的铁器和锡器的人（指刀叉），也是位英雄嘛。

The Old Gentleman led his annual protégé( [法]受惠者 ) southward to the restaurant, and to the table where the feast had always occurred. They were recognized.

“Here comes de old guy,” said a waiter, “dat blows dat same bum(流浪汉) to a meal every Thanksgiving.”

The Old Gentleman sat across the table glowing like a smoked pearl at his corner-stone of future ancient Tradition. The waiters heaped the table with holiday food—and Stuffy, with a sigh that was mistaken for hunger’s expression, raised knife and fork and carved for himself a crown of imperishable bay.

No more valiant(勇敢的) hero ever fought his way through the ranks of an enemy. Turkey, chops, soups, vegetables, pies, disappeared before him as fast as they could be served. Gorged nearly to the uttermost when he entered the restaurant, the smell of food had almost caused him to lose his honor as a gentleman, but he rallied like a true knight. He saw the look of beneficent(行善的) happiness on the Old Gentleman’s face—a happier look than even the fuchsias and the ornithoptera amphrisius had ever brought to it—and he had not the heart to see it wane(减弱).

	「valiant」英勇的。「gorge」拼命地吃（某物），饱食（某物）。「rally」复原，恢复，重新振作。
	
	上一段话才说Stuffy觉得是自己是一位英雄，这一段就描写了这位“英雄”狼吞虎咽的样子了：再也没有像Stuffy这样在敌军人马中杀开一条血路的英雄更勇敢的了。Stuffy以风卷残云之势扫光了眼前的菜。另外作者还用了gentleman和knight两个词来形容他：他跨进饭馆的时候，肚子里已经塞得实实足足，食物的气味几乎使他丧失绅士的荣誉，但他却象一个真正的骑士，打起精神，坚持到底。反讽意味很深。

	这篇文中的感恩一词品来，有讽刺的苦涩，讽刺的是感恩节人们对传统的愚蠢追求。九年来，感恩节这天老绅士都会请Stuffy吃一顿饱饭，两人各取所需。但第十年的感恩节，Stuffy事先被喂了一餐，老绅士再次前来，Stuffy满是惊恐。结局令人深思，两个人出了餐厅都晕倒在地，Stuffy是吃得太饱，而老绅士是太久没吃饿晕了。文中的传统也值得玩味，为什么明明吃饱了的Stuffy还是没有拒绝老绅士的邀请？是因为今年拒绝了明年的大餐就悬了，他也指望着这一年一次的传统呢。

In an hour Stuffy leaned back with a battle won.

“Thankee kindly, sir,” he puffed like a leaky steam pipe; “thankee kindly for a hearty meal.”

Then he arose heavily with glazed(呆滞无神的) eyes and started toward the kitchen. A waiter turned him about like a top, and pointed him toward the door. The Old Gentleman carefully counted out $1.30 in silver change, leaving three nickels for the waiter.

They parted as they did each year at the door, the Old Gentleman going south, Stuffy north.

Around the first corner Stuffy turned, and stood for one minute. Then he seemed to puff out his rags as an owl puffs out his feathers, and fell to the sidewalk like a sunstricken(中暑的) horse.

When the ambulance came the young surgeon and the driver cursed softly at his weight. There was no smell of whiskey to justify a transfer to the patrol wagon, so Stuffy and his two dinners went to the hospital. There they stretched him on a bed and began to test him for strange diseases, with the hope of getting a chance at some problem with the bare steel.

And lo! An hour later another ambulance brought the Old Gentleman. And they laid him on another bed and spoke of appendicitis(阑尾炎), for he looked good for the bill.

But pretty soon one of the young doctors met one of the young nurses whose eyes he liked, and stopped to chat with her about the cases.

“That nice old gentleman over there, now,” he said, “you wouldn’t think that was a case of almost starvation.

Proud old family, I guess.

He told me he hadn’t eaten a thing for three days. ”
