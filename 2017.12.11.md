Chapter 12

The Last Leaf

In a little district west of Washington Square the streets have run crazy and broken themselves into small strips called “places.” These “places” make strange angles and curves. One street crosses itself a time or two. An artist once discovered **a valuable possibility** in this street. Suppose a **collector** with a bill for paints, paper and canvas should, in traversing this route, suddenly meet himself coming back, without a cent having been paid on account!

	【collector】收债人，这里可不是收藏家的意思哦。
	【traverse】横穿，穿过
	【pay sth. on account】赊账买…
	这一句话解释了为什么这么多贫穷的艺术家喜欢扎根在这里，因为这里的街道错综复杂，前来催债颜料、纸张和画布钱的债主会在这人生地不熟的地界，穿来穿去最终一分钱也收不到。而这一点就被艺术家们称作可贵之处（a valuable possibility）。

So, to **quaint** old Greenwich Village the art people soon came **prowling**, hunting for **north windows** and eighteenth-century **gables** and Dutch **attics** and low rents. Then they imported some pewter mugs and a **chafing** dish or two from Sixth Avenue, and became a “colony.”

	quaint	英[kweɪnt]
	美[kwent]
	adj.	古色古香的; 少见的，古怪的; 离奇有趣的，; 做得精巧的;
	[例句]That's how concepts like general welfare start to sound quaint in this age.
	就这样，民众福利这一类概念在这个时代开始变得陈旧起来。

	prowling	
	v.	徘徊; 小心翼翼地移动( prowl的现在分词 ); （动物）潜行（为捕猎等） ; 潜行（图谋不轨等）;
	[例句]There is a strange man prowling in our backyard.
	有个陌生人在我们后院徘徊。

	colony	英[ˈkɒləni]
	美[ˈkɑ:ləni]
	n.	殖民地; 群体; 聚居地; 聚居人群;
	[例句]In France's former North African colonies, anti-French feeling is growing
	在北非的一些前法属殖民地国家，反法情绪日益增长。

	第一部分语序略作调整就会好理解一些：the art people soon came to quaint old Greenwich Village，Greenwich Village真是艺术家的天堂啊~

	他们追求格林尼治村的四样东西：朝北的窗户，18世纪的三角墙，荷兰式的阁楼，以及低廉的房租。三角墙和阁楼都是当时艺术家们喜欢的居所，有良好的采光，租金低廉。

	中国人喜欢的房子是坐北朝南，这样采光更好，那画家们为什么喜欢朝北的窗户呢？因为窗户朝北，房间里一天的光线变化会降到最低，光线对于画家们来说可是至关重要的，所以光线变化越小越好。

At the top of a squatty(低矮宽阔的), three-story brick Sue and Johnsy had their studio. “Johnsy” was familiar for Joanna. One was from Maine, the other from California. They had met at the table d’hôte( [法]定价套餐 ) of an Eighth Street “Delmonico’s,” and found their tastes in art, chicory(菊苣) salad and bishop sleeves so **congenial**(合得来的) that the joint studio resulted.

That was in May. In November a cold, unseen stranger, whom the doctors called Pneumonia(肺炎), stalked about the colony, touching one here and there with his icy fingers. Over on the East Side this ravager(破坏者) strode boldly, smiting his victims **by scores**, but his feet **trod** slowly through the maze of the narrow and moss-grown “places.”

	by scores	英[bai skɔ:z]
	美[baɪ skɔrz]
	[词典]	大量地，大批地;
	[例句]The region has been hit by scores of aftershocks, keeping people there on edge.
	此后该地区又连续受到几十次余震的袭击，当地群众精神万分紧张。

	trod	英[trɒd]
	美[trɑ:d]
	v.	踏出; 踩，踏( tread的过去式 ); 踩成; 步行于;
	[例句]They trod their enemies under foot.
	他们把敌人踩在脚下。

Mr. Pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric(有武士风范的) old gentleman. A mite(小孩) of a little woman with blood thinned by California zephyrs(微风) was hardly **fair game** for the red-fisted, short-breathed old duffer. But Johnsy he **smote**; and she lay, **scarcely** moving, on her painted iron bedstead, looking through the small Dutch window-panes at the blank side of the next brick house.

	smote	英[sməʊt]
	美[smoʊt]
	v.	猛打，重击，打击( smite的过去式 );
	[例句]I smite, you smite, he smites, we done smote!
	我重击，你重击，他重击，我们都重击了！

	scarcely	英[ˈskeəsli]
	美[ˈskersli]
	adv.	几乎不，简直不; 刚刚，才; 决不; （刚） 一…就;
	[例句]He could scarcely breathe
	他几乎喘不过气来。

	bedstead	英[ˈbedsted]
	美[ˈbɛdˌstɛd]
	n.	床架，床的框架;
	[例句]A loose brass knob on the bedstead rattled.
	床架上一个松动的球形铜扣发出嘎啦声。

	【chivalric】有骑士精神的，这里可以理解为肺炎先生可不是个讲风度的老绅士。【zephyrs】西风，这个名字源于希腊神话中的西风神仄费洛斯（zephyrus）。还记得上篇文章中的北风神吗？不记得的话赶紧复习一下哦。
	【fair game】理所当然的抨击对象。<If you say that someone is fair game, you mean that it is acceptable to criticize or attack them.>，上文也交代了Johnsy来自加利福尼亚。

	一个身子单薄，被加利福尼亚州的西风刮得没有血色的弱女子，本不应该是这个有着红拳头、呼吸急促的老家伙的打击对象。（但是，Johnsy却感染了肺炎。）

One morning the busy doctor invited Sue into the hallway with a shaggy(蓬乱的), gray eyebrow.

“She has one chance in—let us say, ten,” he said, as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer.

“And that chance is for her to want to live.

This way people have of lining-up on the side of the undertaker(殡葬员) makes the entire pharmacopeia(药典) look silly.

	【undertaker】殡仪业者，承办丧葬者。【pharmacopeia】医药，药典，代指医学。

	这句话是夸张的幽默用法，强调当时肺炎肆虐，纽约一片死亡气息。人们都不想活，在殡仪馆门口排队等着有事做，这种场景挫伤了医学的锐气，让医学一筹莫展。Silly在这里可以理解为，太多人不想活，医学治病救人反而显得幼稚荒唐。

Your little lady has made up her mind that she’s not going to get well.

Has she anything on her mind?”

“She—she wanted to paint the Bay of Naples some day,” said Sue.

“Paint?—bosh(胡说)! Has she anything on her mind worth thinking about twice—a man, for instance?”

“A man?” said Sue, with a Jews’-harp twang(鼻音) in her voice.

“Is a man worth—but, no, doctor; there is nothing of the kind.”

“Well, it is the weakness, then,” said the doctor.

“I will do all that science, so far as it may filter through my efforts, can accomplish.

But whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession I subtract 50 per cent from the curative power of medicines.

	【carriage】马车。【procession】队伍，行列。【subtract】减，减去。

	肺炎肆虐，患病者意志低落，还没到行将就木之时就已经想身后事了——死后要多少马车出殡。医生也很无奈，碰到这样的情况，他就会把药量减去百分之五十，毕竟对于得了重病的病人来说，拖着无异于折磨。失去了生的希望，一切都将是空谈。

	医生告诉Sue，如果Johnsy能对冬天穿灯笼袖的衣着潮流感兴趣，那么她存活的概率就能从1/10提高到1/5，医生的这一说法不无道理，心态对于病人来说也很重要。

If you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves I will promise you a one-in five chance for her, instead of one in ten.”

After the doctor had gone Sue went into the workroom and cried a Japanese napkin to a pulp(纸浆). Then she swaggered(昂首阔步) into Johnsy’s room with her drawing-board, whistling ragtime(一种爵士乐).

Johnsy lay, scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes, with her face toward the window. Sue stopped whistling, thinking she was asleep.

She arranged her board and began a pen-and-ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story. Young artists must pave their way to Art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to Literature.

As Sue was sketching a pair of elegant horseshow riding trousers and a monocle(单片眼镜) on the figure of the hero, an Idaho cowboy, she heard a low sound, several times repeated. She went quickly to the bedside.

Johnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting—counting backward.

“Twelve,” she said, and a little later “eleven”; and then ‘ten,” and “nine”; and then “eight” and “seven,” almost together.

Sue looked solicitously out the window. What was there to count? There was only a bare, dreary(阴沉的) yard to be seen, and the blank side of the brick house twenty feet away. An old, old ivy vine, gnarled(粗糙多节的) and decayed at the roots, climbed half way up the brick wall. The cold breath of autumn had stricken its leaves from the vine until its skeleton branches clung, almost bare, to the crumbling bricks.

“What is it, dear?” asked Sue.

“Six,” said Johnsy, in almost a whisper.

“they’re falling faster now.

Three days ago there were almost a hundred.

It made my head ache to count them.

But now it’s easy.

There goes another one.

There are only five left now.”

“Five what, dear? Tell your Sudie.”

“Leaves. On the ivy vine.

When the last one falls I must go, too.

I’ve known that for three days.

Didn’t the doctor tell you?”

“Oh, I never heard of such nonsense,” complained Sue, with magnificent scorn.

“What have old ivy leaves to do with your getting well? And you used to love that vine so, you naughty girl.

Don’t be a goosey(笨蛋).

Why, the doctor told me this morning that your chances for getting well real soon were—let’s see exactly what he said—he said the chances were ten to one! Why, that’s almost as good a chance as we have in New York when we ride on the street-cars or walk past a new building.

Try to take some broth(肉汤) now, and let Sudie go back to her drawing, so she can sell the editor man with it, and buy port wine for her sick child, and pork chops for her greedy self.”

“You needn’t get any more wine,” said Johnsy, keeping her eyes fixed out the window.

“There goes another.

No, I don’t want any broth.

That leaves just four.

I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark.

Then I’ll go, too.”

“Johnsy, dear,” said Sue, bending over her, “will you promise me to keep your eyes closed, and not look out the window until I am done working? I must hand those drawings in by to-morrow.

I need the light, or I would draw the shade down.”

“Couldn’t you draw in the other room?” asked Johnsy, coldly.

“I’d rather be here by you,” said Sue.

“Besides I don’t want you to keep looking at those silly ivy leaves.”

“Tell me as soon as you have finished,” said Johnsy, closing her eyes, and lying white and still as a fallen statue, “because I want to see the last one fall.

I’m tired of waiting.

I’m tired of thinking.

I want to turn loose my hold on everything, and go sailing down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.”

“Try to sleep,” said Sue.

“I must call Behrman up to be my model for the old hermit miner.

I’ll not be gone a minute.

Don’t try to move till I come back.”
