I subscribed to the local newspaper years ago, but I barely read it anymore.

I no longer subscribe to the all the same beliefs as my parents, but that doesn't mean we don't share some values.

Bill and his wife subscribe to the notion that disciplining children in any way, shape, or form will harm their emotional development.

## 不同意

- take exception (to something)
  - to disagree with something. 这里是“不同意”，程度还是比较轻的
  - to take offense at something. 这里似乎加深了“不同意”的意味，同时还带有“你的话冒犯了我”的意思

> 总的来说，就是“不同意刚才的观点”

I must take exception to your remark.

If that's what you're saying, then yes, I **take exception**.

Sue **took exception** to Fred's characterization of Bill as a cheapskate.

Excuse me, but I **take exception** to being characterized as some sort of opportunist, just because I happened to make some good investments before the economy collapsed.
