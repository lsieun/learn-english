The **hype** in the **run-up to** what was **billed as** a historic debate between a Fox anchor and a presenter from China’s state broadcaster captured the imagination of millions. But what actually **transpired** in the brief 17-minute **encounter**, **punctuated** by lags in the satellite connection, was disappointingly short on substance.

It was a **culmination** of days of Twitter-**sparring** between the two women, but ultimately **flopped** in an **anti-climax** that left key questions unanswered. What was supposed to be a proxy for the trade war, fought by representatives of television networks favored by their respective country leaders, ended up going nowhere.

There was **no mud-slinging**, as Liu had requested as a **precondition**. But there was **condescension** and **snide** from both sides, mixed with **boilerplate** **pleasantries** like Regan telling Liu, “I appreciate you being here.”

The debate started with a somewhat **testy** **exchange**. Regan had introduced Liu as being “part of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)—a statement that Liu immediately **disputed**.

- journalist

“This is on the record, so please don’t assume that I’m a member and I don’t speak for the Communist party of China,” Liu said. “Here today I’m only speaking for myself, Liu Xin, a **journalist** working for CGTN.”

- call out
  - to publicly criticize or fault (someone) 

CCTV’s live **coverage** of the debate (it could not stream it in China due to “rights issues“) made sure to **call out** Regan for appearing to interrupt Liu as she made her **clarification**. “Within 30 seconds of Liu Xin’s opening, she had already been interrupted by Trish at least three times,” it wrote (link in Chinese).

- cordial
  - pleasant and friendly 热情友好的

The conversation continued on **cordial** terms after that, turning to issues of the **trade negotiations** (“I don’t have any insider information,” Liu said), **intellectual property**, **tariffs**, and **technology transfer**.

Perhaps the most interesting question Regan posed to Liu was one about the mechanisms behind China’s economy.

“I’m paying you a **compliment** here,” Regan said. “Your system of economics is very interesting. You have a **capitalist** system, but it’s state-run. So talk to us about that. How do you define it?”

- spin
  - a way of presenting information or a situation in a particular way, especially one that makes you or your ideas seem good （尤指有利于自己的）导向性陈述

Liu appeared to be caught off-guard by the question, stalling for time as she repeated the question back at Regan. She eventually described **state capitalism** with the **predictable** “socialism with market characteristics,” a **riff** on a frequently used phrase to describe China’s **spin** on capitalism.

- dismay

- abrupt
  - sudden and unexpected, often in an unpleasant way 突然的；意外的

Online, Chinese social media users on Weibo were **dismayed** with how **abruptly** the debate ended. “It finished just like that?” wrote one.

- combative
  - ready and willing to fight or argue 好战的；好斗的；好争论的

Writing after the debate, CCTV praised Regan (link in Chinese) for dropping her **combative**, scene-making style in a show of respect to Liu. “But from Trish’s questions, we can see that she still does not fully understand the situation in China, and is still biased on issues of economics and trade,” it added.

- showdown
  - an argument, a fight or a test that will settle a disagreement that has lasted for a long time 决出胜负的较量；最后的决战

In the end, it was not the **showdown** that many had hoped for. In fact, it seems a stretch to call it a debate, given that it was mostly Regan asking questions about China. Perhaps the two women will have another debate in the days to come. Liu did extend Regan an invitation to visit China.

“If you want to come to China, you’re welcome and I’ll take you around,” she said.
