Cosmos vs Universe

The world that we live in is very vast and boundless. While the human race is confined and live in a small portion of the world, people are aware of the existence of other planets and galaxies as well as many other things in the universe and the cosmos.

**“Cosmos” is defined as a harmonious and orderly whole, a system** that is governed not by human or supernatural laws but by natural law. It is used to refer to objects that exist naturally especially those that can be seen in the sky. The term “cosmos” has two connotations. It comes from the Greek word “kosmos” which means “order, good order,” or “orderly arrangement” from which the verb “kosmein” which means “arrange” or “adorn” is derived and passed on to the English language.

“Universe” is defined as “everything that exists including all matter and energy, the Earth, and everything in it together with **extraterrestrial** or **celestial** bodies such as the **galaxies**, stars, **meteors**, and everything that can be found in **intergalactic** space.” It is everything that existed, that is existing, and will exist. It has three elements, namely; **space and time** or the **vacuum**, **matter and energy** that occupy space and time, and **the physical laws** that govern them which have been constant throughout its history.

The words “cosmos” and “universe” are used synonymously as they refer to the same concept which is the world or nature. “Universe” seems to have a narrower or smaller scope than “cosmos,” though, and “cosmos” signifies a larger and more complex system.

Summary:

- 1.“Cosmos” is a whole harmonious and orderly system that is governed by natural law while “universe” is everything that exists including time and space, matter, and the laws that govern them.
- 2.The word “cosmos” comes from the Greek word “kosmos” which means “order or orderly arrangement” while the word “universe” comes from the Latin word “universus” which means “whole or entire,” also from the Greek “holos” which also means “whole.”
