Gared did not **rise to the bait**. He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen the **lordlings** come and go. “Dead is dead,” he said. “We have no business with the dead.”

“Are they dead?” **Royce** asked softly. “What proof have we?”

“**Will** saw them,” **Gared** said. “If he says they are dead, that’s proof enough for me.”

> 威尔（Will）是权力的游戏序章中守夜人部队的一名游骑兵。序章从威尔的视角叙述了他寻找一股野人部队，直到他被变成尸鬼的威玛·罗伊斯爵士杀死的故事。 威尔在加入守夜人之前是一名偷猎者，在梅利斯特家族的树林里狩猎。一次他在剥鹿皮的时候，恰好被梅利斯特伯爵的自由骑手抓住，后者让他选择穿上黑衣或是被切下一只手。 他选择穿上黑衣成为守夜人。在小说第一卷序章的情节开始时，他已经在长城上服役四年。威尔的潜行和狩猎技巧为他执行游骑兵侦查任务带来极大帮助。

**Will** had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had been later rather than sooner. “My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,” he put in.

Yet it was more than that. Under the wounded pride, **Will** could sense something else in the older man<sub>【注：应该是指Gared】</sub>.

He was a **veteran** of a hundred **rangings** by now, and the endless dark **wilderness** that the **southron** called **the haunted forest** had no more terrors for him.

Until tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an **edge** to this darkness that made his **hackles** rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then north again, farther and farther from the Wall, hard on the track of a band of wildling **raiders**. Each day had been worse than the day that had come before it. Today was the worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the trees **rustle** like living things. All day, **Will** had felt as though something were watching him, something cold and **implacable** that loved him not. **Gared** had felt it too. **Will** wanted nothing so much as to ride **hellbent** for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share with your **commander**<sub>【注：有些感受，只能自己体会到，却无法表达出来，让别人也感受到】</sub>.

Ser **Waymar Royce** was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many **heirs**. He was a handsome youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and **graceful** and slender as a knife. **Mounted** on his huge black **destrier**, the knight **towered** above **Will** and **Gared** on their smaller **garrons**. He wore black **leather** boots, black **woolen** pants, black **moleskin** gloves, and a fine **supple** coat of **gleaming** black **ringmail** over layers of black **wool** and **boiled** leather. Ser **Waymar** had been a **Sworn Brother** of the Night’s Watch for less than half a year, but no one could say he had not prepared for his **vocation**. At least **insofar** as his **wardrobe** was concerned.

His **cloak** was his **crowning** glory; **sable**, thick and black and soft as skin. “Bet he killed them all himself, he did,” **Gared** told the **barracks** over wine, “twisted their little heads off, our mighty warrior.” They had all shared the laugh.

- reflect
  - 认真思考；沉思 to think carefully and deeply about sth

It is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, **Will** **reflected** as he sat shivering atop his garron. **Gared** must have felt the same.

- fortnight
  - 两星期 two weeks

“**Mormont** said as we should track them, and we did,” **Gared** said. “They’re dead. They shan’t trouble us no more. There’s hard riding before us. I don’t like this weather. If it snows, we could be a **fortnight** getting back, and snow’s the best we can hope for. Ever seen an ice storm, my lord?”

> **杰奥·莫尔蒙**（Jeor Mormont）总司令，也时常被称作熊老，是第997任守夜人军团总司令，黑城堡要塞的总司令和最高指挥官。**杰奥**，以前曾是莫尔蒙家族的族长和熊岛的统治者，为了把自己的位子让给儿子**乔拉·莫尔蒙**伯爵，他选择了加入守夜人。他有一只会说话的宠物渡鸦。  
> **熊岛**的莫尔蒙家族（House Mormont of Bear Island）是一个古老的，骄傲的，富有荣誉感的家族，效忠于**临冬城**的**史塔克**家族。他们的领地在熊岛，一个位于**临冬城**西北边的岛屿。他们的**族徽**是**一只身处绿色丛林的熊**。家族箴言是**昂首屹立**。莫尔蒙家族是极少数拥有祖传的**瓦雷利亚钢**的家族之一，他们的族剑是一把名为**长爪**的长柄剑。但是，由于熊岛缺乏有价值的资源，**莫尔蒙**其实是一个很贫穷的家族。他们的房屋是由石头堆成的， 周围只有些许土制栅栏。

The lordling seemed not to hear him. He studied the deepening twilight in that half-bored, half-distracted way he had. **Will** had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that. “Tell me again what you saw, **Will**. All the details. Leave nothing out.”

**Will** had been a hunter before he joined the Night’s Watch. Well, a **poacher** in truth. **Mallister** freeriders had caught him red-handed in the Mallisters’ own woods, skinning one of the Mallisters’ own **bucks**, and it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand. No one could move through the woods as silent as **Will**, and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent.

> 海疆城的**梅利斯特**家族（House Mallister of Seagard），是河间地的一支贵族家庭。他们的领地是海疆城。  
> 他们的族徽是靛蓝底色上的一只展翅银鹰。他们的族语是“无可企及”。梅利斯特家族成员多有蓝灰色的眼眸，容貌高贵且骄傲。由于他们统治的地方以往屡受铁民骚扰，梅利斯特家族的人对铁民有一股深入骨髓的不信任感。

“The camp is two miles farther on, over that **ridge**, hard beside a stream,” **Will** said. “I got close as I dared. There’s eight of them, men and women both. No children I could see. They put up a lean-to against the rock. The snow’s pretty well covered it now, but I could still make it out. No fire burning, but the **firepit** was still plain as day. No one moving.

The young knight turned back to his **grizzled** man-at-arms. Frostfallen leaves **whispered** past them, and **Royce**’s **destrier** moved **restlessly**. “What do you think might have killed these men, **Gared**?” **Ser Waymar** asked **casually**.

“It was the cold,” **Gared** said with **iron** **certainty**. “I saw men freeze last winter, and the one before, when I was half a boy. Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and how the ice wind comes **howling** out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold. It **steals** up on you quieter than **Will**, and at first you shiver and your teeth **chatter** and you **stamp** your feet and dream of **mulled** wine and nice hot fires. It burns, it does. Nothing burns like the cold. But only for a while. Then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up, and after a while you don’t have the strength to fight it. It’s easier just to sit down or go to sleep. They say you don’t feel any pain toward the end. First you go weak and **drowsy**, and everything starts to fade, and then it’s like sinking into a sea of warm milk. Peaceful, like.”
