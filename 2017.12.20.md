Previous Story

作者与Mrs. Strickland彼此非常投缘。在两人不断的交往中，作者了解到Strickland一家有一个儿子和一个女儿并且Mr Strickland是一个不爱文学的典型股票经纪人。Mrs. Strickland最后答应作者某天邀请他和Mr Strickland见面。

Chapter 5

But when at last I met Charles Strickland, it was under circumstances which allowed me to do no more than just **make his acquaintance**. One morning Mrs. Strickland **sent me round** a note to say that she was giving a dinner-party that evening, and one of her guests had failed her. She asked me to stop the gap. She wrote:

	make the acquaintance of sb./make sb.’s acquaintance 结识某人

	
	send round	英[send raund]
	美[sɛnd raʊnd]
	[词典]	把…发送过去，请[派]…过去[过来];
	[例句]Don't miss out your brother when you send round the invitations.
	发送请帖时不要把你兄弟给漏了。

*It’s only decent to warn you that you will be bored to extinction. It was a thoroughly dull party from the beginning, but if you will come I shall be uncommonly grateful. And you and I can have a little chat by ourselves.*

It was only neighborly(友好的) to accept.

When Mrs. Strickland introduced me to her husband, he gave me a rather **indifferent** hand to shake. Turning to him **gaily**(愉快地), she attempted a small jest(俏皮话).


	indifferent
	英[ɪnˈdɪfrənt]
	美[ɪnˈdɪfərənt, -ˈdɪfrənt]
	adj.	漠不关心的; 无关紧要的; 中立的; 中等的;
	[例句]People have become indifferent to the suffering of others.
	人们对别人的痛苦已经变得无动于衷。


	gaily	英[ˈgeɪli]
	美[ˈɡeli]
	adv.	快乐地，喜气洋洋地;
	[例句]Magda laughed gaily.
	玛格达开心地笑了起来。

“I asked him to show him that I really had a husband.

I think he was beginning to doubt it.”

Strickland gave the polite little laugh with which people acknowledge a **facetiousness**(笑话) in which they see nothing funny, but did not speak. 

	facetiousness	英[fə'si:ʃəsnəs]
	美[fə'si:ʃəsnəs]
	n.	滑稽;
	[例句]Jastrow said, with tremulous facetiousness.
	杰斯特罗说着，显出抖抖嗦嗦的滑稽样子。

New arrivals claimed my host’s attention, and I was left to myself. 

	claim: to call for or need; deserve. 举例：this problem claims our attention    

When at last we were all assembled, waiting for dinner to be announced, I reflected, while I chatted with the woman I had been asked to “take in,” that civilized man practices a strange **ingenuity** in wasting/ on tedious exercises/ the brief span of his life. 

	ingenuity
	英[ˌɪndʒəˈnju:əti]
	美[ˌɪndʒəˈnu:əti]
	n.	独创性; 足智多谋，心灵手巧; 独出心裁，设计新颖; 巧妙，精巧;
	[例句]Inspecting the nest may require some ingenuity.
	探查鸟巢是需要些技巧的。


It was the kind of party/ which makes you wonder/ why the hostess has troubled to bid her guests, and why the guests have troubled to come. 

There were ten people. They met with **indifference**, and would part with relief. It was, of course, a purely social function. 

	indifference
	英[ɪnˈdɪfrəns]
	美[ɪnˈdɪfərəns, -ˈdɪfrəns]
	n.	冷淡; 不重视，不在乎，漠不关心; 中立，中性; 无差;
	[例句]He displayed a sublime indifference to the distinction between right and wrong.
	他对是非之间的差别根本就无动于衷。

The Stricklands “owed” dinners to a number of persons, whom they took no interest in, and so had asked them; these persons had accepted. Why? To avoid the tedium(单调乏味) of dining tête-à-tête( [法]两人之间), to give their servants a rest, because there was no reason to refuse, because they were “owed” a dinner.

	owe	英[əʊ]【lsieun】这里应该理解为“亏欠”
	美[oʊ]
	vt.	感激; 欠…债; 应归功于; 怀有情感;
	[例句]I always suspected she owed her first job to her friendship with Roger
	我一直怀疑她仗着自己是罗杰的朋友才得到第一份工作。

The dining-room was **inconveniently** crowded. There was a K. C. and his wife, a Government official and his wife, Mrs. Strickland’s sister and her husband, Colonel MacAndrew, and the wife of a Member of Parliament. 

	inconveniently
	英[ˌɪnkən'vi:nɪəntlɪ]
	美[ˌɪnkən'vi:nɪrntlɪ]
	adv.	不方便地;
	[例句]Because my question has caused the very old one to you inconveniently, I express deep regret at this.
	由于我的问题给您造成了很大的不便，我对此深表遗憾。

It was because the Member of Parliament found that he could not leave the House that I had been invited. The **respectability**(名望) of the party was **portentous**(影响重大的). The women were too nice to be well dressed, and too sure of their position to be amusing. The men were solid. There was about all of them an air of well-satisfied prosperity.

	respectability
	英[rɪˌspektəˈbɪləti]
	美[rɪˌspɛktəˈbɪlɪti]
	n.	体面; 名望; 得体; 高尚;
	[例句]He began his professional life as an accountant, the very model of respectability and conservatism.
	他开始了会计师的职业生涯，一份典型的体面而保守的工作。

	portentous	英[pɔ:ˈtentəs]
	美[pɔ:rˈtentəs]
	adj.	预兆的; 自命不凡的; 凶兆的; 装腔作势的;
	[例句]There was nothing portentous or solemn about him. He was bubbling with humour.
	他一点也不装腔作势或故作严肃，浑身散发着幽默。

	prosperity	英[prɒˈsperəti]
	美[prɑ:ˈsperəti]
	n.	繁荣; 成功; 兴旺，昌盛;
	[例句]A prosperity never seen before appeared in the countryside.
	农村出现了前所未有的繁荣。

Everyone talked a little louder than natural in an **instinctive** desire to make the party go, and there was a great deal of noise in the room. 

	instinctive	英[ɪnˈstɪŋktɪv]
	美[ɪnˈstɪŋktɪv]
	adj.	天生的，生来的; 本能的，直觉的;
	[例句]It's an absolutely instinctive reaction — if a child falls you pick it up
	这完全是本能的反应——如果一个孩子摔倒了你会把他扶起来。


But there was no general conversation. Each one talked to his neighbor; to his neighbor on the right during the soup, fish, and entrée; to his neighbor on the left during the roast, sweet, and savory(开胃菜). They talked of the political situation, and of golf, of their children and the latest play, of the pictures at the Royal Academy, of the weather, and their plans for the holidays. 

There was never a pause, and the noise grew louder. Mrs. Strickland might congratulate herself that her party was a success. Her husband played his part with **decorum**(得体). Perhaps he did not talk very much, and I fancied there was/ toward the end/ a look of fatigue/ in the faces of the women on either side of him. They were finding him heavy. Once or twice Mrs. Strickland’s eyes rested on him somewhat anxiously.

	decorum	英[dɪˈkɔ:rəm]
	美[dɪˈkɔrəm, -ˈkor-]
	n.	端庄得体; 体统;
	[例句]I was treated with decorum and respect throughout the investigation.
	整个调查过程中他们都有礼有节，对我很尊重。

At last she rose and **shepherded**(带领) the ladies out of one room. Strickland shut the door behind her, and, moving to the other end of the table, took his place between the K. C. and the Government official. He passed round the port again and handed us cigars. 

	shepherd	英[ˈʃepəd]
	美[ˈʃepərd]
	n.	牧羊人，羊倌; 牧师; 指导者;
	vt.	带领，引导; 牧（羊），放牧; 照看;
	[例句]She was shepherded by her guards up the rear ramp of the aircraft.
	她在警卫的护送下上了飞机尾部的舷梯。

The K. C. remarked on the excellence of the wine, and Strickland told us where he got it. We began to chat about **vintage**s and tobacco. The K. C. told us of a case he was engaged in, and the Colonel talked about polo(马球). 

	vintage	英[ˈvɪntɪdʒ]
	美[ˈvɪntɪdʒ]
	adj.	酿酒的; 老式的，过时的; 最好的，最有特色的; 古老而享有声誉的;
	n.	美酒; 葡萄产量; 酒产年，酒产地; 制造年份;
	v.	为酿酒而收（葡萄）; 用葡萄酿酒;
	[例句]If you can buy only one case at auction, it should be vintage port.
	如果你在拍卖会上只能买一样东西，那就应该是上等的波尔图葡萄酒。

I had nothing to say and so sat silent, trying politely to show interest in the conversation; and because I thought no one was in the least concerned with me, examined Strickland at my ease. He was bigger than I expected: I do not know why I had imagined him slender and of insignificant appearance; **in point of** fact he was broad and heavy, with large hands and feet, and he wore his evening clothes clumsily. He gave you somewhat the idea of a coachman(马车夫) dressed up for the occasion. 

	in point of	英[in pɔint ɔv]
	美[ɪn pɔɪnt ʌv]
	[词典]	关于， 就…而论;
	[例句]Why had she ever trusted her? In point of fact she never had, she reminded herself.
	她为什么要相信她呢？实际上，她从未信任过，她提醒着自己。

He was a man of forty, not good-looking, and yet not ugly, for his features were rather good; but they were all a little larger than life-size, and the effect was **ungainly**(笨拙的). He was clean shaven, and his large face looked uncomfortably naked. His hair was reddish, cut very short, and his eyes were small, blue or gray. He looked commonplace(平凡的). 

	ungainly	英[ʌnˈgeɪnli]
	美[ʌnˈɡenli]
	adj.	笨拙的; 难看的; 不雅的; 别扭的;
	[例句]The dog, an ungainly mongrel pup, was loping about the road
	那只丑陋的杂种幼犬在马路上到处乱跑。

I no longer wondered that Mrs. Strickland felt a certain embarrassment about him; he was scarcely a credit to a woman who wanted to make herself a position in the world of art and letters. It was obvious that he had no social gifts, but these a man can do without; he had no eccentricity even, to take him out of the common run; he was just a good, dull, honest, plain man. One would admire his excellent qualities, but avoid his company. He was null(不存在的). He was probably a worthy member of society, a good husband and father, an honest broker; but there was no reason to waste one’s time over him.

The season was drawing to its dusty end, and everyone I knew was arranging to go away. Mrs. Strickland was taking her family to the coast of Norfolk, so that the children might have the sea and her husband golf. We said good-bye to one another, and arranged to meet in the autumn. But on my last day in town, coming out of the Stores, I met her with her son and daughter; like myself, she had been making her final purchases before leaving London, and we were both hot and tired. I proposed that we should all go and eat ices in the park.

I think Mrs. Strickland was glad to show me her children, and she accepted my invitation with alacrity(乐意). They were even more attractive than their photographs had suggested, and she was right to be proud of them. I was young enough for them not to feel shy, and they chattered merrily about one thing and another. They were extraordinarily nice, healthy young children. It was very agreeable under the trees.

When in an hour they crowded into a cab to go home, I strolled idly to my club. I was perhaps a little lonely, and it was with a touch of envy that I thought of the pleasant family life of which I had had a glimpse. They seemed devoted to one another. They had little private jokes of their own which, unintelligible(愚笨的) to the outsider, amused them enormously. Perhaps Charles Strickland was dull judged by a standard that demanded above all things verbal scintillation(口齿伶俐); but his intelligence was adequate to his surroundings, and that is a passport, not only to reasonable success, but still more to happiness. Mrs. Strickland was a charming woman, and she loved him. I pictured their lives, troubled by no untoward(意外的) adventure, honest, decent, and, by reason of those two upstanding, pleasant children, so obviously destined to carry on the normal traditions of their race and station, not without significance. They would grow old insensibly(渐进地); they would see their son and daughter come to years of reason, marry in due course—the one a pretty girl, future mother of healthy children; the other a handsome, manly fellow, obviously a soldier; and at last, prosperous in their dignified(体面的) retirement, beloved by their descendants, after a happy, not unuseful life, in the fullness of their age they would sink into the grave.

That must be the story of innumerable couples, and the pattern of life it offers has a homely grace. It reminds you of a placid(平静的) rivulet(小溪), meandering(蜿蜒) smoothly through green pastures and shaded by pleasant trees, till at last it falls into the vasty(广阔的) sea; but the sea is so calm, so silent, so indifferent, that you are troubled suddenly by a vague uneasiness(焦躁). Perhaps it is only by a kink(奇想) in my nature, strong in me even in those days, that I felt in such an existence, the share of the great majority, something amiss(有差错的). I recognized its social value, I saw its ordered happiness, but a fever in my blood asked for a wilder course. There seemed to me something alarming in such easy delights. In my heart was a desire to live more dangerously. I was not unprepared for jagged(崎岖的) rocks and treacherous(暗藏危险的) shoals(浅滩) if I could only have change—change and the excitement of the unforeseen.
