The Captain **flushed** a little through the bronze on his face. He was silent for a while, gazing sadly into the twilight.

How long ago it seemed now! **Truly, Fate and Father Time had tricked him sorely**. Just a few years interposed(插入) between himself and happiness!

No, my dear friend.

While it isn’t exactly January and May, it’s a clear case of October and pretty early in June. ”

“I’d always do what you wanted me to do, Theo.

If you wanted to—”

You think now that you would, but you wouldn’t.

Please don’t ask me any more. ”

The Captain had lost his battle. But he was a **gallant**(勇敢的) warrior, and when he rose to make his final **adieu**(再见) his mouth was **grimly** set and his shoulders were squared.
