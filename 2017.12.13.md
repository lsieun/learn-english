两个美国青年Bob和Jimmy是一对非常要好的朋友，二人选择了不同的人生路线，并相约20年后再相会，谁料20年光景，已物是人非……

Chapter 14

After Twenty Years

The policeman **on the beat** moved up the avenue impressively. The impressiveness was habitual and not for show, for spectators were few. The time was barely ten o’clock at night, but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh(几乎) depeopled(减少人) the streets.

	on the beat警察执勤巡逻。
	well-nigh 几乎。

Trying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements, turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown(沿着) the pacific thoroughfare(大道), the officer, with his stalwart(强壮的) form and **slight swagger**(昂首阔步), made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace. The **vicinity** was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed.

	「trying doors」检查门是否关好了。
	「thoroughfare」大道，大街。
	「stalwart」强壮的，健壮的。
	「swagger」大摇大摆、趾高气昂。slight swagger 是带点傲气
	这一句话刻画了一位尽职的警察形象：一位警察边走边沿街一家家打量巡视，他挥一挥警棍，弄出些复杂又花哨的动作，不时警觉地向一片安宁的大街尽头望去，这位健壮威武、不带傲气的警官活像一位和平卫士。

	vicinity	英[vəˈsɪnəti]
	美[vɪˈsɪnɪti]
	n.	附近地区; 附近，邻近; 大约的程度或者数量; 〈罕〉近亲;
	[例句]There were a hundred or so hotels in the vicinity of the railway station
	在火车站附近大约有100家旅馆。

When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly.

“It’s all right, officer,” he said, reassuringly.

“I’m just waiting for a friend.

It’s an appointment made twenty years ago.

Sounds a little funny to you, doesn’t it? Well, I’ll explain if you’d like to make certain it’s all straight.

About that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands—‘Big Joe’ Brady’s restaurant. ”

“Until five years ago,” said the policeman.

“It was torn down then. ”

The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white scar near his right eyebrow. His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly set.

	这一段话描写了Bob的外貌，火柴光照亮了他的脸，那张苍白的国字脸上有着敏锐的双眼，右边眉毛下有一个小小的白色疤痕。此外还提到了一个小细节：他的领带夹是一颗巨大的钻石，这样的装饰显得有些古怪。
	这个小细节是一个伏笔，之后的内容中也会提到这样的细节，比如他有一块好表，手表盖上镶着一圈钻石。这些细节都显示出来他在西部大赚了一笔。

“Twenty years ago to-night,” said the man, “I dined here at ‘Big Joe’ Brady’s with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the world.

He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers, together.

I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty.

The next morning I was to start for the West to make my fortune.

You couldn’t have dragged Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth.

Well, we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time, no matter what our conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come.

We figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made, whatever they were going to be. ”

“It sounds pretty interesting,” said the policeman.

“Rather a long time between meets, though, it seems to me.

Haven’t you heard from your friend since you left?”

“Well, yes, for a time we corresponded,” said the other.

“But after a year or two we lost track of each other.

You see, the West is a pretty big proposition, and I kept hustling(奔忙) around over it pretty lively.

	proposition：事情、任务。西部太大了，我一直在那里忙来忙去。

But I know Jimmy will meet me here if he’s alive, for he always was the truest, stanchest(最忠诚的) old chap in the world.

He’ll never forget.

I came a thousand miles to stand in this door to-night, and it’s worth it if my old partner turns up. ”

The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with small diamonds.

“Three minutes to ten,” he announced.

“It was exactly ten o’clock when we parted here at the restaurant door. ”

“Did pretty well out West, didn’t you?” asked the policeman.

“You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half as well.

	「you bet」当然，一定，一点没错。

He was a kind of plodder(辛勤工作的人), though, good fellow as he was.

	「plodder」慢条斯理、死板的人， <If you say that someone is a plodder, you have a low opinion of them because they work slowly and steadily but without showing enthusiasm or having new ideas.>
	He was a kind of plodder, though, good fellow as he was.是一个as引导的让步结构，意思是尽管Jimmy人很不错，但他有点死板，不愿接受新事物。

I’ve had to compete with some of the sharpest wits going to **get my pile**.

	「get / make a pile」赚钱。

A man **gets in a groove** in New York.

	 「get / be stuck in a groove」墨守成规，安逸度日。

It takes the West to put a razor-edge on him. ”

	「put a razor-edge on sb.」让某人更聪明、机敏，有些锋芒。razor-edge ,这里指刀锋，锋芒。
	整句大意：警察和Bob攀谈起来，问Bob在西部混的不错吧？Bob回答道：“当然了！我倒是希望Jimmy做得能有我一半好。他人很不错，但是有点死板。我为了赚钱要和很多聪明人斗智斗勇。在纽约呆着，一个人可以墨守成规过舒服日子，要想变得聪明点，那得到西部去体验体验。”

The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two.

“I’ll be on my way.

Hope your friend comes around all right.

Going to call time on him sharp?”

	这里「call time on sth.」表示“结束某事”，
	「sharp」这里做副词表示“…整点时刻”。针对「sharp」的用法，再给大家举个例子：e.g. The party had to stop sharp at 12 o’clock. 

“I should say not!” said the other.

“I’ll give him half an hour at least.

If Jimmy is alive on earth he’ll be here by that time.

So long, officer. ”

“Good-night, sir,” said the policeman, passing on along his beat, trying doors as he went.

There was now a fine, cold drizzle(毛毛雨) falling, and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir(活动的) in that quarter hurried dismally(沉闷地) and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands. And in the door of the hardware store the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment, uncertain almost to absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and waited.

About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat, with collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite side of the street. He went directly to the waiting man.

“Is that you, Bob?” he asked, doubtfully.

“Is that you, Jimmy Wells?” cried the man in the door.

“Bless my heart!” exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other’s hands with his own.

“It’s Bob, sure as fate.

I was certain I’d find you here if you were still in existence.

Well, well, well!—twenty years is a long time.

The old restaurant’s gone, Bob; I wish it had lasted, so we could have had another dinner there.

How has the West treated you, old man?”

“Bully; it has given me everything I asked it for.

You’ve changed lots, Jimmy.

I never thought you were so tall by two or three inches. ”

“Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty. ”

“Doing well in New York, Jimmy?”

“Moderately.

I have a position in one of the city departments.

Come on, Bob; we’ll go around to a place I know of, and have a good long talk about old times. ”

The two men started up the street, arm in arm. The man from the West, his **egotism**(自负) enlarged by success, was beginning to **outline** the history of his career. The other, submerged in his overcoat, listened with interest. At the corner stood a drug store, **brilliant with electric lights**. When they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other’s face.

The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm.

	「egotism」自我中心主义。「outline」在文中是动词用法，意思是“概述、概括”。
	两人走到光下，不约而同地看了对方一眼，Bob立刻意识到眼前这个人不是Jimmy，因为Jimmy是高鼻梁，而眼前这个人是塌鼻子。

“You’re not Jimmy Wells,” he snapped.

“Twenty years is a long time, but not long enough to change a man’s nose from a Roman to a pug(扁平鼻). ”

“It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one,” said the tall man.

“You’ve been under arrest for ten minutes, ‘Silky’ Bob.

Chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat with you.

	she指Chicago，芝加哥警方推测通缉犯Bob可能会到纽约来，于是发了电报告诉纽约警方想和他谈谈。

Going quietly, are you? That’s sensible.

Now, before we go to the station here’s a note I was asked to hand you.

You may read it here at the window.

It’s from Patrolman Wells. ”

The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him. His hand was steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little by the time he had finished. The note was rather short. 

Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the match to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in Chicago. Somehow I couldn’t do it myself, so I went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job. Jimmy
