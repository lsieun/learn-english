Initially, a lot of advanced changes were planned for OpenJDK 7, such as the modular VM and lambda expression support, but due to various technical and organizational reasons, after Sun Microsystems' **acquisition** by Oracle, most of the new features were postponed for the next versions of OpenJDK. This expedited the release. It reached General Availability status on 28 July 2011 and was the first OpenJDK version released as a Reference Implementation for the Java platform.
