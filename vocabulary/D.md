## Drop-in replacement

**Drop-in replacement** is a term used in **computer science** and other fields. It refers to the ability to **replace** one hardware (or software) component **with** another one **without** any other code or configuration changes being required and resulting in no negative impacts. Usually, the replacement has some benefits including one or more of the following:

- increased security
- increased speed
- increased feature set
- increased compatibility (e.g. with other components or standards support)
- increased support (e.g. the old component may no longer be supported, maintained, or manufactured)
