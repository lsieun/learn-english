## In a nutshell

简言之；简而言之；总而言之

例句：

In object-oriented programming, the concept of **interfaces** forms the basics of contract-driven (or contract-based) development. **In a nutshell**(简言之；简而言之；总而言之), interfaces define the set of methods (contract) and every class which claims to support this particular interface must provide the implementation of those methods: a pretty simple, but powerful idea.
