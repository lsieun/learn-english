Alchemy was the "chemistry" of the Middle Ages and early modern times; since c.1600 the word has been applied distinctively to the pursuit of the **transmutation** of baser metals into gold, which, along with the search for the universal solvent and the panacea, were the chief occupations of early chemistry.
