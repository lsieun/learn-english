## What’s the difference between i.e. and e.g.?

They may be small, but their power to befuddle writers and speakers of the English language is mighty.

The term `i.e.` is a shortening of the Latin expression `id est`, which translates to “that is.” It is used to introduce a rephrasing or elaboration on something that has already been stated.

The term `e.g.` is an abbreviation of the Latin expression `exempli gratia`, meaning “for the sake of example” or more colloquially, “for example.” This term is used to introduce examples of something that has already been stated.
