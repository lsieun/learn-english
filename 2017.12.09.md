The Cop and the Anthem

On his bench in Madison Square Soapy moved **uneasily**. When **wild** goose honk(叫) high of nights, and when women without **sealskin** coats grow kind to their husbands, and when Soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the park, you may know that winter is near at hand.

A dead leaf fell in Soapy’s lap. That was Jack Frost’s card. Jack is kind to the regular **denizen**s(居民) of Madison Square, and gives fair warning of his annual call.

The hibernatorial(冬眠的) ambitions of Soapy were not of the highest. In them there were no considerations of Mediterranean cruises, of soporific(令人昏昏欲睡的) Southern skies drifting in the Vesuvian Bay. Three months on the Island was what his soul craved. Three months of assured board and bed and **congenial**(意气相投的) company, safe from Boreas and **bluecoats**, seemed to Soapy the essence of things desirable.

For years the hospitable(好客的) Blackwell’s had been his winter **quarters**.

On the previous night three Sabbath newspapers, distributed beneath his coat, about his ankles and over his lap, had failed to repulse(驱逐) the cold as he slept on his bench near the **spurting**(喷射的) **fountain** in the ancient square. So the Island loomed big and timely in Soapy’s mind. He **scorned** the **provisions** made in the name of charity for the city’s dependents.

In Soapy’s opinion the Law was more benign than **Philanthropy**. There was an endless round of institutions, **municipal** and eleemosynary(免费的), on which he might set out and receive **lodging** and food accordant with the simple life. But to one of Soapy’s proud spirit the gifts of charity are encumbered(受束缚的). If not in coin you must pay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands of philanthropy(慈善事业).

Soapy, having decided to go to the Island, at once set about accomplishing his desire. There were many easy ways of doing this. The pleasantest was to **dine** luxuriously at some expensive restaurant; and then, after declaring **insolvency**(无力偿付债务), be handed over quietly and without uproar to a policeman.

Soapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his **vest** upward. He was shaven, and his coat was decent and his neat black, ready-tied four-in-hand had been presented to him by a lady **missionary** on Thanksgiving Day. If he could reach a table in the restaurant unsuspected success would be his. The portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter’s mind. A roasted mallard duck(绿头鸭), thought Soapy, would be about the thing—with a bottle of Chablis( [法]沙布利干白葡萄酒 ), and then Camembert( [法]卡门贝干酪 ), a demi-tasse( [法]小杯浓咖啡 ) and a cigar. One dollar for the cigar would be enough. The total would not be so high as to call forth any supreme manifestation of revenge from the café management; and yet the meat would leave him filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge.

But as Soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head waiter’s eye fell upon his frayed(磨损的) trousers and decadent(破烂的) shoes. Strong and ready hands turned him about and conveyed him in silence and haste to the sidewalk(人行道) and **avert**ed the **ignoble** fate of the menaced mallard.

Its **crockery**(餐具) and atmosphere were thick; its soup and napery(桌布) thin. Into this place Soapy took his accusive shoes and tell-tale trousers without challenge.

“Now, get busy and call a cop,” said Soapy.

“And don’t keep a gentleman waiting.”

“No cop for youse,” said the waiter, with a voice like butter cakes and an eye like the cherry in a Manhattan cocktail.

“Hey, Con!”

**Neatly** upon his left ear on the **callous**(硬的) pavement two waiters **pitched** Soapy. He arose, joint by joint, as a carpenter’s rule opens, and beat the dust from his clothes. Arrest seemed but a rosy(美好的) dream. The Island seemed very far away. A policeman who stood before a drug store two doors away laughed and walked down the street.
