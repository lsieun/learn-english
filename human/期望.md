"Expected from” means that something, whether material or immaterial, is being anticipated to come from someone and that there will be **an actual  transfer** of that something from the source to the one expecting it.

- Eg : A negative response **was expected from** the manager.

“Expected of” means believing that someone is capable of living up to or adopting some standard of performance, behavior, or way of thinking. "Expected of" implies **a movement** of **after-the-fact anticipation**. **When you want to express the person who you expected would do something, one would normally use "of"**.

- Eg: It **was expected of** you to do a good job."
- Eg: It **is expected of** you to find the solution.
