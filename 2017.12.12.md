Previous Story

Johnsy身患重病，悲观认为常青藤上最后一片叶子掉落之时，自己也会逝去；住在楼下的老Behrman是个失败的画家，一心想要画出伟大作品。一夜风吹雨打后，叶子能安然不落吗？Johnsy能否活下去？而Behrman能否造就名作？

Chapter 13

Old Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor beneath them. He was past sixty and had a Michael Angelo’s Moses beard curling down from the head of a satyr along the body of an imp(小魔鬼). Behrman was a failure in art. Forty years he had **wielded the brush** without getting near enough to **touch the hem(褶边) of his Mistress’s robe**(长袍). He had been always about to paint a masterpiece, but had never yet begun it. For several years he had painted nothing except now and then a daub in the line of commerce or advertising. He earned a little by serving as a model to those young artists in the colony who could not pay the price of a professional. He drank gin to excess, and still talked of his coming masterpiece. **For the rest** he was a fierce little old man, who **scoffed terribly at** softness in any one, and who regarded himself as especial **mastiff(大驯犬)-in-waiting** to protect the two young artists in the studio above.

	「wield the brush」表示“挥动画笔”，借喻Behrman画画这件事；
	「touch the hem of someone’s robe」是一个固定搭配表示“对某人的尊重”，这个搭配出自圣经故事（马太福音 9：20）：一个女人在被治愈之后触摸耶稣的衣服。
	「Mistress」本义是指：A woman mastered a skill or branch of learning. e.g. a mistress of culinary art（一位烹饪艺术家）这里用Mistress来象征Behrman心中的艺术女神。
	总的来说，这句话承接着前文说的Behrman是个失败的艺术家，画了一辈子画 ，始终都没有画出能称之为艺术的作品。
	「for the rest」除此之外。
	「scoff at」嘲笑，讥讽。
	「mastiff」獒犬，-in-waiting这个词缀有一个意义是<Denoting a position as attendant to a royal personage .>，所以这里的mastiff-in-waiting可以理解为忠诚的看门獒犬。

这一句话概括了Behrman“矛盾”的性格，一方面，他极端瞧不起别人展现出来的柔情，另一方面，他又把自己当成保护楼上两位年轻艺术家的看门獒犬。看来这位凶狠暴躁的小老头内心也有柔软和温情。

Sue found Behrman smelling strongly of juniper(杜松) berries in his dimly-lighted den(简陋污秽的小室) below. In one corner was a blank canvas on an easel that had been waiting there for twenty-five years to receive the first line of the masterpiece. She told him of Johnsy’s fancy, and how she feared she would, indeed, light and fragile as a leaf herself, float away when her slight hold upon the world grew weaker.

Old Behrman, with his red eyes, plainly streaming, shouted his contempt and derision(嘲笑) for such idiotic imaginings.

“Vass(What)!” he cried.

“Is dere(there) people in de(the) world mit der foolishness to die because leafs(leaves) dey(they) drop off from a confounded(该死的) vine? I haf(have) not heard of such a thing.

No, I will not bose(pose) as a model for your fool hermit(隐居者)-dunderhead(笨蛋).

Vy(Why) do you allow dot(that) silly pusiness(business) to come in der(the) prain(brain) of her? Ach, dot poor lettle(little) Miss Johnsy.”

“She is very ill and weak,” said Sue, “and the fever has left her mind morbid(病态的) and full of strange fancies.

Very well, Mr. Behrman, if you do not care to pose for me, you needn’t.

But I think you are a horrid(极讨厌的) old—old flibberti-gibbet(饶舌的人).”

“You are just like a woman!” yelled Behrman.

“Who said I will not bose? Go on.

I come mit you.

For half an hour I haf peen(been) trying to say dot I am ready to bose.

Gott(God)! Dis(This) is not any blace(place) in which one so goot as Miss Yohnsy(Johnsy) shall lie sick.

Some day I vill(will) baint(paint) a masterpiece, and ve(we) shall all go away.

Gott! Yes.”

Johnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs. Sue pulled the shade down to the window-sill, and motioned Behrman into the other room. In there they peered out the window fearfully at the ivy vine. Then they looked at each other for a moment without speaking. A persistent, cold rain was falling, mingled with snow. Behrman, in his old blue shirt, took his seat as the hermit-miner on an **upturned** kettle for a rock.

	「upturned」翻转的。
	Behrman来给Sue当模特，是一位隐居的采矿者形象，但是Sue工作室条件简陋，没有石头布景，就让Behrman坐在倒扣着的水壶上，充当岩石。

When Sue awoke from an hour’s sleep the next morning she found Johnsy with dull, wide-open eyes staring at the drawn green shade.

“Pull it up! I want to see,” she ordered, in a whisper.

Wearily Sue obeyed.

But, lo! After the beating rain and fierce gusts of wind that had endured through the livelong(整个的) night, there yet stood out against the brick wall one ivy leaf. It was the last on the vine. Still dark green near its stem, but with its serrated(锯齿状的) edges tinted(被…轻微染色) with the yellow of dissolution(腐朽) and decay, it hung bravely from a branch some twenty feet above the ground.

“It is the last one,” said Johnsy.

“I thought it would surely fall during the night.

I heard the wind.

It will fall to-day, and I shall die at the same time.”

“Dear, dear!” said Sue, leaning her worn face down to the pillow, “Think of me, if you won’t think of yourself.

What would I do?”

But Johnsy did not answer. The lonesomest(最孤单的) thing in all the world is a soul when it is making ready to go on its mysterious, far journey. The fancy seemed to possess her more strongly as **one by one** the ties that bound her to friendship and to earth were loosed.

	One by one是个插入语，如果放到分句最后会好理解一点。as the ties / that bound her to friendship and to earth / were loosed one by one.

	这句话颇有意蕴，描写了人之将死时的状态，通过这一句话，我们或许能理解此时Johnsy的状况。一个准备走上神秘遥远的死亡道路的心灵，是全世界最寂寞、最悲哀的了。当她与尘世及友情之间的联系一点点地脱离时，那个玄想似乎更有力地掌控了她。「the fancy」在这指的就是死亡。

The day wore away, and even through the twilight they could see the lone ivy leaf clinging to its stem against the wall. And then, with the coming of the night the north wind was again loosed, while the rain still beat against the windows and pattered(嗒嗒地下) down from the low Dutch eaves.

When it was light enough Johnsy, the merciless, commanded that the shade be raised.

The ivy leaf was still there.

Johnsy lay for a long time looking at it. And then she called to Sue, who was stirring her chicken broth over the gas stove.
“I’ve been a bad girl, Sudie,” said Johnsy.

“Something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how wicked I was.

It is a sin to want to die.

You may bring me a little broth now, and some milk with a little port in it, and—no; bring me a hand-mirror first, and then pack some pillows about me, and I will sit up and watch you cook.”

An hour later she said—

“Sudie, some day I hope to paint the Bay of Naples.”

The doctor came in the afternoon, and Sue had an excuse to go into the hallway as he left.

“Even chances,” said the doctor, taking Sue’s thin, shaking hand in his.

	「even」（成败机会）各半的，对半的。之前医生对Sue说Johnsy病得太重，治愈的几率只有1/10了，但如果心态好能提高到1/5，而现在多亏了那一片仍然坚挺着的常春藤叶，Johnsy生存的几率更大了，有1/2了。

	医生说他要去楼下查看另一位病人——Behrman，他的这句话也是埋了线索。

“With good nursing you’ll win.

And now I must see another case I have downstairs.

Behrman, his name is—some kind of an artist, I believe.

Pneumonia(肺炎), too.

He is an old, weak man, and the attack is acute.

There is no hope for him; but he goes to the hospital to-day to be made more comfortable.”

The next day the doctor said to Sue: “She’s out of danger.

You’ve won.

Nutrition and care now—that’s all. ”

And that afternoon Sue came to the bed where Johnsy lay, contentedly knitting a very blue and very useless woolen shoulder scarf, and put one arm around her, pillows and all.

“I have something to tell you, white mouse,” she said.

“Mr. Behrman died of pneumonia today in the hospital.

He was ill only two days.

The janitor(门房) found him on the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain.

His shoes and clothing were wet through and icy cold.

They couldn’t imagine where he had been on such a dreadful night.

And then they found a lantern, still lighted, and a ladder that had been dragged from its place, and some scattered brushes, and a palette(调色板) with green and yellow colors mixed on it, and—look out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall.

Didn’t you wonder why it never fluttered or moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it’s Behrman’s masterpiece—he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell. ”
